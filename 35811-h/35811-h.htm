<div id="p1" title="PREFACE">
<h2 id="c1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>To most of us the Matelda of Dante has been
scarcely more than a shape existing in the
mind of a poet. It may be that she now
stands before us not only as a woman of flesh
and blood, but as one who has for us in these
days a marvellous message. One of the great
cloud of witnesses to the love and glory of the
Lord Jesus Christ, speaks to us in a German
B&eacute;guine, who is now recognised by many as
the original of her who conducted Dante into
&ldquo;the terrestrial Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether or no we regard her as the guide
of Dante, may she be to us a means whereby
we &ldquo;forget the things that are behind, and
press forward to those that are before.&rdquo; May
she yet be to some sorrowful souls the guide
into the blessed Garden of God&mdash;the garden
no longer guarded by a flaming sword, but
opened to the sinner who &ldquo;has washed his
robes, and made them white in the Blood of
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
the Lamb.&rdquo; May some to whom the future
is dark and fearful, and who carry as a heavy
burden the sin of past years, be led on across
the river into the light, the sweetness, and the
rest of the green pastures of Christ&mdash;the sin
and sorrow left behind, remembered no more,
for the Lord remembers them not. And in His
Presence, where there is the fulness of joy, the
sufferings of this present time can also be forgotten,
for sorrow rejoiceth before Him.</p>
<p>Six persons have up to this time been regarded
as the original of the Matelda of Dante.
The Countess Matilda of Tuscany most commonly
till modern times; Matilda, mother of
Otto the Great; the nun of Hellfde, Matilda
of Hackeborn; the &ldquo;gentle lady&rdquo; of the <i>Vita
Nuova</i>, and of the <i>Convito</i>; Vanna, the lover
of Guido Cavalcanti; and finally, the B&eacute;guine,
also of Hellfde, known as Matilda of Magdeburg.</p>
<p>The claims of the Countess Matilda appear
to rest on her name only, without further traits
of resemblance; those of Matilda of Hackeborn
have been disproved by the chronological
researches of Preger; of the rest, only Matilda
of Magdeburg shows any resemblance striking
enough to lead to the conclusion that she was
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
in the mind of Dante when he described the
lady who sang the sweet songs of Paradise.
Scartazzini, who regards the gentle lady of
the <i>Vita Nuova</i> as the true Matelda, can assign
no valid reason for doubting that Matilda
the B&eacute;guine has a better claim. I think that
few can doubt it who have carefully read the
proofs furnished by the ancient records of the
convent of Hellfde, and by the book of Matilda
of Magdeburg. These proofs will be found
summarised in a brochure published at Munich
in 1873, &ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s Matelda, <i>ein akademischer
Vortrag von Wilhelm Preger</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The extracts from her book, which I have
endeavoured to translate, are chosen from the
passages in her prose and poetry which best
exemplify the Divine teaching, rather than from
those which identify her with the Matelda of
Dante. That which is useless, except for purposes
of historic research, has been passed
over. The writing of Mechthild, especially
when in rhyme and measure, is difficult to
translate, and I am conscious that the rendering
of her poems is extremely imperfect.</p>
<p>In one case extracts from more than one
have been placed together; in others, only a
part of a longer poem has been given. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
object has been rather to pass on Mechthild&rsquo;s
message than to give an adequate idea of the
whole book, a great deal of which is defaced
by the superstition of her times.</p>
<p>But the truth which is eternal is found
richly in the midst of much that is false, and
thus far, she being dead yet speaketh. That
she learnt so fully much that we are now
very slow to learn, is a fact the more remarkable
when we consider, how lost and buried
was the Gospel teaching of the Apostles in
the ages that succeeded them. Their &ldquo;successors&rdquo;
had been too often employed in
&ldquo;darkening counsel by words without knowledge.&rdquo;
All the more do the love and wisdom
of God shine forth in the teaching which those
who turned to Him only, received from His
lips. Mechthild was one who sat at His feet
and heard His words, and it is well for us
to hear that which she learnt of Him. A
somewhat free translation has been necessary,
in order to render in English the equivalent
to German medi&aelig;val language; but I trust
that the sense and meaning have been faithfully,
however unworthily, rendered.</p>

<div id="p2" title="The Cloister of Hellfde">
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">[1]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="large">The Cloister of Hellfde</span></h2>
<p><i>How, and by whom the cloister was founded
and built, in which the two blessed maidens,
Mechthild and Gertrude, served God.</i></p>
<p>When men had counted one thousand two
hundred and nineteen years since the birth of
Christ our dear Lord and Saviour, it came to
pass, by the special grace of God, that the
mighty and noble Count Burkhardt of Mansfeldt
built a convent of nuns near to the castle
of Mansfeldt. This convent was dedicated by
Count Burkhardt to Mary the Blessed Virgin;
and therein did he place pious nuns, taken
from the convent of S. James, called Burckarsshoff,
of the Cistercian order, near Halberstatt.</p>
<p>The wife of the above-mentioned Count
Burkhardt was a Countess of Schwarzbruck,
Elisabeth by name. She was the mother of
two daughters&mdash;one named Gertrude, the other
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Sophia. Gertrude married a young Count of
Mansfeldt, the cousin of Count Burkhardt, and
Sophia married a Burggraf of Querfurdt.</p>
<p>Now Count Burkhardt, in the same year that
he finished the building and furnishing of the
aforesaid convent, departed joyfully from this
present life; and after his departure the noble
countess, Frau Elisabeth, his widow, found that
the place chosen near the castle of Mansfeldt
was not suitable for a spiritual life, and therefore,
in the fifth year after the death of her lord,
by the advice of persons of good understanding,
she removed and rebuilt the convent at
a place called Rodardsdorff. And when it had
remained there twenty-four years it was again
removed to Helpede or Hellfde, as the following
history relates.</p>
<p>Now when the above-named countess, Frau
Elisabeth, had removed the convent to Rodardsdorff,
she betook herself thither, and there did
she serve God, and ended her life well and
blissfully.</p>
<p>The first abbess of this convent was Frau
Kunigunde of Halberstatt, and a truly God-fearing
and devout woman. And when she
had lived seventeen years at Rodardsdorff, she
there died a blessed death in the year 1251.
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
And on the day following her departure there
was chosen by the direction of the Holy Ghost,
as the above-named abbess, Frau Kunigunde,
had predicted, to be abbess in her room, the
sister Gertrude, born of the noble family of
Hackeborn, and a sister by birth of the blessed
and marvellously endowed Mechthild, of whom
the Book of spiritual graces gives the history.</p>
<p>This Abbess Gertrude was chosen unanimously,
as being of a wholly spiritual and
devout manner of life. She was nineteen
years old at the time of her election, and she
filled her office for forty years and eleven
days; and during her time the nuns of the
cloister lived holy and God-fearing lives, and
God bestowed upon them marvellous gifts.
And when she had lived fifty-nine years, she
was taken away from this world, joyfully and
piously, and entered into the gladness and the
glory of the everlasting kingdom in the year of
our Lord 1291.</p>
<p>And when the cloister had now been standing
twenty-four years at Rodardsdorff, and she
had been abbess at that place seven years, then
for the third time was the site of the convent
changed, and it was renewed and rebuilt as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>It was seen and observed by Count Hermann
of Mansfeldt, a son of Frau Gertrude, the elder
daughter, and Burggraf Burkhardt of Querfurdt,
a son of Frau Sophia, the younger daughter of
the mighty Count Burkhardt of Mansfeldt, the
founder of the convent, that at Rodardsdorff
there was a great want of water, so that it could
not have been well for the convent longer to
remain there. Therefore these two counts
made an exchange of the convent with the two
barons, the Lord Albert and the Lord Ludolf
of Hackeborn, for the manor and village of
Hellfde, adding on their part other estates.
And at Hellfde was the cloister for the third
time rebuilt.</p>
<p>The nuns of the convent of Rodardsdorff
were removed to the convent of Hellfde in the
year 1258, on the Sunday of the Holy Trinity.
To this inauguration of the convent did the
aforesaid two Counts of Mansfeldt and Querfurdt
invite many lords and gentlemen, such as
Rupert, the archbishop of Magdeburg, Bishop
Volradt, of Halberstatt, also many other lords
and prelates, spiritual and temporal.</p>
<p>Count Hermann of Mansfeldt had no male
issue, but only three daughters. Two of these,
Sophia and Elisabeth, did he place in the convent
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
of Hellfde, where they lived godly lives.
One of them became an able writer, who
wrote many good and useful books for the
convent, and afterwards became the abbess
thereof. The other was for a long time
prioress, and was a skilful painter, who
laboured industriously at the adorning of the
books and of other things which pertained to
the service of God. The third daughter was
given in marriage by Count Hermann of Mansfeldt
to a Baron von Rabbinswalt.</p>
<p>And because the aforesaid Count Hermann
had no male heirs, he sold the castle and the
county of Mansfeldt to the Burggraf Burkhardt
of Querfurdt. And thus did Mansfeldt and the
land come into the family of Querfurdt, as also
other estates of Count Hermann in the land of
Thuringia.</p>
<p>In the cloister of Hellfde there lived many
most excellent persons, the children of counts
and lords, and of nobles and common people.
And for near ninety years the community lived
after the manner of cloistered nuns, a life as
it were angelic. And the Lord Jesus was so
intimately known to the persons of this community
that they communed with Him, as with
their most dearly beloved Lord and Bridegroom,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
as one good friend would speak with another.
And the angels of heaven had a special joy and
gladness in beholding this blessed company, of
which much might be written, but which for
brevity&rsquo;s sake we will not write, as much is told
of these things in the Book of spiritual graces.</p>
<p>At last, in the year 1342, after the birth of
Christ our dear Lord, there arose a great dispute
between the Duke of Brunswick and the
Count of Mansfeldt, whose name was Burkhardt.
And this dispute arose because a Duke
of Brunswick, Albert by name, was chosen by
some to be Bishop of Halberstatt, and by
others there was chosen the son of Count
Burkhardt of Mansfeldt, whose name was also
Albert. And the choice of this latter was confirmed
by the Pope.</p>
<p>Therefore there arose war and fighting, so
that the Dukes of Brunswick invaded the
land of the Count of Mansfeldt with rage and
violence, and spoiled and wasted and burned
all before them. And by means of this visitation
of God was the convent burned to the
ground, and utterly ruined and destroyed.
And as the chronicles relate, it was Duke
Albert of Brunswick (the Bishop-elect) and a
lord of Weringenrod, who with their own hands
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
set fire to the convent. What it was that moved
them to do this, is known to Him who knoweth
all things.</p>
<p>There were also several horsemen, and others
with cross-bows and other murderous weapons,
who ran to seize the abbess and some of her
godly spiritual children, intending to do them
grievous harm. Yet, as the enemies themselves
bore witness, when they were a stone&rsquo;s throw
from these maidens they lost, as it were, their
strength and force, and could proceed no
further. And although it was against the will
and desire of Duke Henry of Brunswick (who
was also Bishop of Heldesheim) and of Duke
Otto of Brunswick, and of others who were
with Duke Albert, and though these endeavoured
with all possible good faith to prevent it,
the cloister was nevertheless pillaged and burnt.</p>
<p>After this, in the year 1346, the convent was
for the fourth time again rebuilt, in the outer
part of the town of Eisleben. (From the
German edition of the <i>Mechthilden Buch</i>
1503.)</p>
<h3 id="c3">Gertrude Von Hackeborn.</h3>
<p>It was during the forty years in which the
convent was under the able direction of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Abbess Gertrude von Hackeborn, that it became
distinguished for the high attainments of its
inmates. Gertrude was of the family of the
Barons of Hackeborne, whose castle and manor
was situated a little to the east of the town of
Eisleben. At the age of nineteen she was
already marked out, by her spiritual and mental
endowments, as a capable directress of the nuns
placed beneath her care. It was she who persuaded
her brothers Albert and Ludolf to give
the manor of Hellfde for the new site of the
convent, which had been for twenty-four years
at Rodardsdorff. Many gifts were afterwards
given to the convent by the Barons of Hackeborn,
in consideration of the distinguished
place held there by their two sisters, Gertrude
and Matilda.</p>
<p>For a long time Gertrude was supposed to
be the author of the book known as the <i>Gertruden
Buch</i>, out of which Ter Steegen made
the extracts which he published in his &ldquo;Lives
of Holy Souls,&rdquo; assigning them to the Abbess
Gertrude von Hackeborn. It seems now, however,
clearly ascertained that the book so long
attributed to the abbess was the work of a
nun of the convent, also named Gertrude, to
whom reference will be made later on. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
this book, as also in the book called the
<i>Mechthilden Buch</i>, which was dictated chiefly
by Matilda of Hackeborn, and completed
by the writers (also nuns of the convent)
after her death, much is related of the Abbess
Gertrude. She is described as a woman of
remarkable character, uniting love, gentleness,
and piety with practical wisdom, good
sense, and mental culture. The chief feature
which appears to have impressed the sisterhood,
was &ldquo;the sweetness of the love which
dwelt in her innermost heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to the last her love was active and
practical. When in her latter days she was
completely crippled, and in constant suffering,
she insisted upon being carried to the sisters
who were ill in bed, that she might speak to
them a word of comfort. When at last her
speech failed her, her beaming eyes, her loving
countenance, and the gentle movement of her
hand assured the sisters who stood around her
that her affection for them remained untouched
by her bodily infirmities. The sisters said it
was not a melancholy, but a joyful, duty to
watch by her bed of weakness and suffering.</p>
<p>But it was never the case during her long
superintendence of the convent that this
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
remarkable power of loving interfered with the
strictest discipline, or with the wise and careful
ordering of the convent life. She had no easy
task when many daughters of the highest
families of the North German nobles were
committed to her care. They were accustomed
to rule rather than to obey, and to live idle
lives of pleasure and self-indulgence. But
under the loving direction of the Abbess
Gertrude order and industry flourished, and a
desire to learn became very remarkable amongst
these German ladies. Gertrude taught by her
example, by the power of her word, by the
decision and good sense which made themselves
felt in all she said and did.</p>
<p>Above all things, are we told, she required
and insisted upon a thorough and careful
knowledge of the Bible. She made it her
constant care that the convent should have
an increasing supply of the best books, which
she either bought, or copied by means of some
of the nuns. &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that
if the zeal for study should decrease, and the
knowledge of Holy Scripture diminish, all true
spiritual life would come to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was soon an excellent school formed
in the convent, which has left proofs of its
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
remarkable character, as in the case of the
books of Gertrude and Matilda, which were
written by nuns of the convent. The second
part of the <i>Gertrude Book</i>, written by the Nun
Gertrude herself, is said to be an example of
fluency in Latin rarely found amongst the
women of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The life at Hellfde was a very busy life, and
had nothing of the usual littleness of convent
rule. With great spiritual fervour, there was
at the same time a spirit of liberty and cheerfulness
that helped forward the constant,
serious, diligent work of the house. Studying
and copying, illuminating, working and
singing, occupied the sisters, as well as the
care of the poor and the sick; and above all,
the study of the Word of God.</p>
<p>Besides the two sisters, the Abbess Gertrude
and Matilda of Hackeborn, two other nuns
were distinguished by remarkable gifts. One
of these, called on account of her office the
Lady Matilda, was the leader and teacher of
the choir, and also the chief teacher in the
school of the convent. She appears to be the
same as Matilda von Wippra mentioned in
the Querfurdt Chronicles. Much is related
of her great gift as a teacher, and of the power
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
which accompanied her words. &ldquo;Her words,&rdquo;
so it is said in the <i>Gertrude Book</i>, &ldquo;were
sweeter than honey, and her spirit was more
glowing than fire.&rdquo; To her mainly was the
school of Hellfde indebted for its wide reputation.</p>
<p>When the Abbess Sophia von Querfurdt (the
successor of Gertrude) resigned her office in
the year 1298, it was the Lady Matilda who
took the direction of the convent, which remained
without an abbess for five years.
Matilda, however, filled this post for one year
only, as she died in 1299. She was remembered
for &ldquo;the burning desire which she had
for the salvation of souls,&rdquo; and was deeply
lamented by the sisters whom she had loved.
They spoke often of her sweet voice, and her
friendliness, and her holy conversation.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, was the Nun Gertrude,
whose name is attached to the <i>Gertrude
Book</i>, four of the five books of which were
written in Latin by an unnamed sister, and
one book, the second, was the work of Gertrude
herself.</p>
<p>Her history is but little known. She was
born on January 6, 1256, apparently in Thuringia,
and of poor parents, and from her fifth
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
year she had been an inmate of the convent.
Very early she became remarkable for her
thirst for knowledge, and as a girl she devoted
herself to severe study, having the singular predilection
of an enthusiastic love of grammar.
She soon left far behind her all the other nun-students,
and till her twenty-fifth year was
entirely absorbed in secular learning.</p>
<p>It was then that the great era in her life,
described by her in the <i>Gertrude Book</i>, is
to be dated. It was her conversion to God,<sup><a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></sup>
her passage from death to life. She knew for
the first time the love of Him who had borne
her sins; she knew herself justified by faith in
Him. This happened in the year 1281. More
will be related of this remarkable woman.</p>
<p>It may have been that amongst the means
which led to her conversion was an event
which happened sixteen years earlier, and
which has yet to be related. But before
entering upon this part of the history of
Hellfde, a few words must be said regarding
the dark side of the picture presented to us
in the records of this and other convents of
the thirteenth century.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<h3 id="c4">The Dark Side of Hellfde.</h3>
<p>That to Christian life in each of the past
nineteen centuries there is a dark side, is an
obvious fact. But as the dark side has been
constantly regarded as the bright side by the
Christians of each century, our task in discovering
it must not consist merely of a study
of old records. We have to compare the facts
related, and the praise and blame attached to
them, with something less variable than the
human conscience and human opinion.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;piety,&rdquo; attributed to the medi&aelig;val
saints, even when, as in the case of the nuns of
Hellfde, it actually existed, included a mass of
heathenish superstition, of unwholesome excitement
of the brain and nerves; of blank
ignorance of the true meaning of a great part
of the Word of God; and in most cases, of
abject submission to a fallen and heretical
Church.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;best books&rdquo; of which the Abbess
Gertrude formed her convent library contained
grains of truth in masses of error, and
some true facts smothered beneath piles of
legendary rubbish. To find the pearls at the
bottom of the sea of superstition and senseless
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
legend, is at times a despairing endeavour.
Yet the pearls are there, and must have been
there; for the gates of the grave have never
prevailed against the true Church of God.
Some there always were taught by the Holy
Spirit of God, and believing in the midst of
their errors and wanderings the great eternal
truths of the Gospel.</p>
<p>If we are to find true faith, if we are to find
truth at all in the Middle Ages, we must find
it amongst innumerable human inventions,
and shining like a gem in the dark caverns of
human folly. Can we say that in the nineteenth
century it is otherwise? It were well
to consider, and use for the search-light we
so deeply need, the unchangeable Word of the
living God.</p>
<p>Apart from the error taught by &ldquo;the Church&rdquo;
in those past ages&mdash;saint-worship, purgatory,
the merit of human works, and many more&mdash;a
bewildering element of confusion presents
itself in the atmosphere of visions and revelations
in which the &ldquo;pious&rdquo; perpetually lived,
or desired to live. For to live what has been
called in our times &ldquo;the higher Christian life,&rdquo;
meant at that time to be a seer of visions, and
a dreamer of dreams. The seeing of visions
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
was an attainment as much to be desired as to
live in temperance, or godliness, or honesty.</p>
<p>Whilst in our days the wholesome fear of
being sent to a lunatic asylum serves as a
check upon the wild imagination of undisciplined
woman kind, the strangest performances
and utterances might in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries procure for the unfortunate
woman a halo in the pictures which
perpetuated her memory.</p>
<p>It is well to look at the matter of visions
and revelations in the light of Holy Scripture.
That the servants of God have seen visions
divinely shown to them, no one can doubt who
believes the Bible; nor that they have from
time to time received direct revelations from
God. Also, we read as a promise made to
Christian people, that &ldquo;your young men shall
see visions, and your old men shall dream
dreams; and on My servants and on My
hand-maidens I will pour out in those days of
My Spirit, and they shall prophesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first place, therefore, we must admit
that visions and revelations are, in the cases
here mentioned, a reality, and a special gift of
God, in consequence of the exaltation of Christ
to the right hand of God, This is the explanation
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
of these facts given by the Apostle Peter
in the 33rd verse of the 2nd chapter of the
Acts.</p>
<p>But when we read the various accounts in
the Acts of the fulfilment of this promise, or
the accounts in the Old Testament of similar
visions and revelations, we find one marked
distinction between these accounts and those
given in medi&aelig;val legends. In the Bible the
point is, not the state of exaltation to which
such and such a man or woman attained, but,
leaving them out of the question altogether,
we are simply told what it was God showed
or revealed to His servants. The seeing of
visions is never spoken of as being the highest
state of Christian life in the New Testament,
or of spiritual life in the Old Testament. On
the contrary, God on some occasions gave
revelations to the most unworthy, and simply
used them to speak the words He put into
their mouths, whether they would or no&mdash;a
truth which he taught to Balaam by using an
ass as an example.</p>
<p>But in medi&aelig;val times, a <i>state</i> in which the
man, or more frequently the woman, became
liable to visions, was the thing mainly to be
desired. It was not as in the case of Amos,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
who was content to go on herding his cows
and picking his figs till the Lord gave him
his message. The medi&aelig;val saint was trained
and wrought upon by fasting and watching,
by the study of the wildest legends, and by
a conviction that the seeing of visions betokened
a state of special holiness. This preparation
of the mind, and one may say mainly
of the <i>body</i>, for an unnatural and unwholesome
condition produced the desired effect. The
attacks of catalepsy, of convulsions and other
diseased symptoms, were hailed as supernatural
signs, and the disorder of the brain as a work
of the Spirit. And from one to another the
infection spread, as the convulsions and delusions
excited envy and admiration, and a
straining of the mind after something of like
sort.</p>
<p>The atmosphere, therefore, of the convent of
Hellfde, and of many other convents of Germany
and Belgium, was scarcely a wholesome
one; and we must disentangle the spiritual
teaching, which truly came from God, from
the &ldquo;revelations&rdquo; which, if spiritual at all, and
not wholly the result of disease, were the work
of the evil one.</p>
<p>But whilst amongst facts well known to
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
medical scientists, and amongst facts belonging
to still unexplored and unknown regions
of psychology, there may be quite enough to
account for the stories, if really true, of the
mass of medi&aelig;val visions, we must remember,
also, that a great many of these stories were
the inventions of those whose interest it was
to compose them.</p>
<p>The disastrous fact remained that, by means
of these fables, or of real hallucinations, errors
in belief and in practice were taught and encouraged.
It would not occur to those brought
up in a belief of superstitions, which had descended,
under other names, from heathen times,
to sift or examine the legends which were their
daily food. It is for us to sift out from
amongst the working of disordered brains,
and the inventions of ignorant people, the
true teaching which they received from the
only Wise God, who cared for His loving, but
ignorant, children of the Middle Ages, as He
cares now for His more enlightened, but alas!
more lukewarm, children of the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>There is one more remark to be made with
regard to the accounts given by really holy
people of their visions and dreams. Occasionally,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
it was merely a form of writing in
symbol, as when John Bunyan describes having
seen in his dream Christian escaping from the
City of Destruction. There were two reasons
for this in the case of the medi&aelig;val &ldquo;Friends
of God.&rdquo; It was, in the first place, dangerous
to say in plain words that which would have
brought down upon them the curse of the
Church. They spoke, therefore, largely in
symbol, whether by word or by forms and
devices of architecture. This language was
common to them, and it was well understood
by those who had the key in their common
faith.</p>
<p>In the second place, the want of adequate
words to express spiritual truths must always
be felt, and much can be said in symbol which
could not be said at much greater length in
plain speech. In how many words could that
be taught us which we learn from the one
expression, &ldquo;The Lamb of God&rdquo;?</p>
<p>And that many of those of whom the histories
remain, were truly God&rsquo;s children, truly taught
by the Holy Ghost, and in continual communion
with Him as a real and solid fact, we cannot
doubt. They lived a true life of intercourse
with Him, clouded and bewildered by the errors
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of their times, by their unnatural bodily conditions,
and by the fear of sinning against the
authority which some of them believed to be
from God&mdash;the fatal power of the Roman
Church.</p>
<p>In this dreamland of visions and revelations
the nuns of Hellfde lived&mdash;or rather, into it
they frequently wandered. They certainly at
times trod the solid earth, and fulfilled their
various duties in a practical manner. They
also spent much time, more, no doubt, than
many spend now, in &ldquo;the good land, the land
of brooks of water, of fountains and depths
that spring out of valley and hills, and that
drinketh water of the rain of heaven.&rdquo; It was
a familiar land to those who abode in Him who
is there.</p>
<p>And it is a relief to find that, in spite of their
extreme love and reverence for the Abbess
Gertrude, they had no visions to report as seen
by her. She probably had more to do with
creatures of flesh and blood, with the strong
wills and natures of the girls sent to her from
the castles of the nobles, than with creatures
of her own imagination; and she looked for
revelations, and found them in the Word of
God. &ldquo;She undertook the most menial work,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
writes one of the compilers of the <i>Mechthild
Book</i>, &ldquo;and took a considerable part in the
common employments of the sisters. Sometimes
she was the first and the only one at
work till she called others to help her, or
led them to do so by her example and
her pleasant, friendly words. However busy
she might be, she always found time to visit
each one who was sick, and inquire if there
was anything she needed. And with her own
hands she waited upon them, either bringing
them refreshments, or soothing and comforting
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She read the Holy Scriptures very diligently,
and with great delight, as often as she could,
and required of those under her care that they
should do the same. In prayer she was very
fervent and reverent, she seldom prayed without
tears. She had a wonderful quietness of spirit;
and at her hours of prayer her heart was so
peaceful and free from care, that if she were
called to speak to any one, or to other business,
she went back afterwards and prayed as quietly
as if she had not been disturbed. Amongst
the children she was the gentlest and kindest,
and with the older maidens the holiest and
most sensible of friends, and with the elder
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
women the most affectionate and wise. She
was never to be seen idle; either she had a
piece of work on hand, or she was reading, or
teaching, or praying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It can, therefore, easily be imagined that the
Abbess Gertrude suffered neither from catalepsy
nor convulsions, but that she was a wholesome
and cheerful woman. In her last days she had
a paralytic seizure, which deprived her of the
power of speech for some time before her death;
but she appeared to be fully conscious, and
interested as before in the sisters of the
convent.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Matilda.</h3>
<p>We must now go back to the time when
the Abbess Gertrude was in full strength and
activity at the age of thirty-three. In that year,
1265, there arrived at the convent of Hellfde
an infirm, worn-out B&eacute;guine, a namesake of
two inmates of the convent&mdash;Matilda von
Hackeborn and the Lady Matilda of the choir.
The B&eacute;guine went by the name of Matilda
of Magdeburg.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know as much
of her history as she related to the nuns of
Hellfde. As it is, we have but an outline of
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
it. We know thus much, that for Christ&rsquo;s
sake she had &ldquo;renounced worldly honour
and worldly riches.&rdquo; She had evidently been
brought up, writes Preger, &ldquo;under the influence
of court life and of knightly company,
and we see that she was accustomed to the
manners of noble ladies, and to the language
of the higher classes. There is a chivalric
tone in her expressions which seems to link
her words with the knightly poetry of her
time, a poetry then at the height of its cultivation.
And as in her words, so in her
actions&mdash;there was a freedom and powerful
independence which betoken high birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet of her family and of her birthplace
nothing is known. The date of her birth we
know, the year 1212. Apparently her home
was not far from Magdeburg. We are told
of her brother Baldwin, later a Dominican
friar, that from a child he had been &ldquo;brought
up in all good manner of living and in virtuous
habits.&rdquo; Matilda, therefore, had no doubt been
carefully educated.</p>
<p>Others said of her, &ldquo;that from her childhood
she had led an innocent, unsullied life.&rdquo; Of
herself she says, &ldquo;that in her earliest childhood
her sins were many and great. But that even
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
then, whenever she had a trouble and was sad,
she prayed to God. I knelt down before my
Beloved, and said, O Lord, now I am unhappy.
Can it be for Thy glory that I should go away
uncomforted! But I was the most simple and
ignorant of any who ever desired to walk in
the way of life. Of the malice of the devil, I
knew nothing; of the misery of the world, I
knew nothing whatsoever; and the false profession
of people who are called spiritual was
also unknown to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must say this for the honour of God,
that one day in my twelfth year, when I was
all alone, I received the greeting of the Holy
Ghost, unworthy sinner as I was, in such overflowing
measure, that I never afterwards could
endure the thought of committing a great and
deadly sin. This blessed greeting was repeated
day after day, and it filled me with love and
sorrow. I had learnt from God alone what is
Christian faith, and I made it my rule of life;
thus my heart was kept pure, but of the mysteries
of God I knew nothing as yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst during my youth I lived with my
friends and relations, amongst whom I was the
best beloved, the mysteries of God remained
unknown to me. But during that time I long
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
had the desire that, without any fault of mine, I
might be despised by the world, whilst meanwhile
the sweetness and honour of the world
seemed greater to me day by day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is all we can learn of the early years of
Matilda in her unknown home; but we have
in few touches a picture of a rare and simple
nature, humbled by the sense of sin, but proud
enough to desire to be despised; sweet enough
also to be loved with unusual love, and to find
it a delight.</p>
<p>In the year 1235, at the age of twenty-three,
she tore herself from those who thus loved her
and went to Magdeburg, where she only knew
one person, a friend of her family. But she
avoided this one friend, lest he should persuade
her to give up her determination to live alone
for God. She asked to be received in a convent,
but she was refused. She was unknown and
without any means, and she was looked upon
with suspicion and contempt. She had her
desire. She was alone and despised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But God,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;never forsook me.
He filled me so continually with the sweetness
of His love, He drew me into such intimacy
with Himself, and He showed me such unspeakable
wonders of His heart, that I could
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
well afford to lose the world and all that is
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What were the further wanderings of Matilda
we do not know, but it was only a little
while after her refusal at the convent that she
became one of the persecuted order of the
B&eacute;guines.</p>
<h3 id="c6">A word as to the B&eacute;guines.</h3>
<p>There lived at Li&egrave;ge, at the end of the twelfth
century, a priest named Lambert le B&egrave;gues.
His name does not prove him to have been a
stammerer; on the contrary, he was a preacher
of great fervour, and attracted multitudes to his
sermons. Le B&egrave;gues was probably the name
of his family.</p>
<p>At that time the Bishop of Li&egrave;ge, whose
name was Raoul, was a man of evil reputation.
He had formerly been Archbishop of Mainz,
but had been deposed from his office on
account of simony. At Li&egrave;ge he sold by
auction in the market-place the church preferments
that fell to his share. The clergy of Li&egrave;ge,
who had not been shining examples of holy
living even before the arrival of Bishop Raoul,
were now encouraged by his example to live
in a disorderly manner, and the morals of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
town of Li&egrave;ge were at a very low ebb when
Lambert began his preaching there.</p>
<p>It would seem that at that time, both in
towns and country places, there were a number
of wandering priests, who went about preaching
and administering the Sacraments, without
being under the orders of any special bishop.
Probably they were more or less associated
with the lay preachers of the &ldquo;Brethren,&rdquo; called
in a vague way the Waldensian Brethren, whose
evangelising was carried on so extensively as
to bring upon them much persecution in the
whole of Western Europe.</p>
<p>It was in order to direct this zeal for evangelising
into more Catholic channels that
Francis of Assisi and Dominic founded the
orders of predicant friars; just as in our days
the &ldquo;Church Army&rdquo; in England has been
formed to bring under Church authority the
work of evangelisation, which had been set
on foot by the Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Lambert was apparently one of the independent
priests who preached on their own
account, and was, therefore, free to speak unwelcome
truths. He had been originally a
chorister in S. Paul&rsquo;s Church at Li&egrave;ge. He
was probably a man with means of his own;
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
for not only did he preach earnestly and constantly
against the worldliness of the professing
Church, but he provided a practical means of
separating from the world.</p>
<p>In a large garden which he had by the river
side beyond the city walls he built a number
of small separate houses, which he filled with
women of all classes who desired to live a
secluded life and devote themselves to good
works. In the middle of the garden he built
a church, dedicated to S. Christopher, which
was finished in the year 1184. Lambert then
placed his community under the care of a
priest.</p>
<p>These B&eacute;guine sisters took no vows; they
were free to leave the community when they
chose to do so. They retained possession of
their money and property. They were under
no convent rules; they simply promised obedience
to their Superior as long as they remained
in the B&eacute;guinage. But if they wished to return
to ordinary life, or to marry, they had a right
to do so, as married women living, of course,
no longer in the community. They were not
required to wear any special dress, but to be
clothed in &ldquo;modest apparel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lived either alone in one of the little
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
houses, or two or more together, keeping house
for themselves, and having their rooms very
simply furnished. They did their own baking
and brewing; and if they had no means of their
own, they had some employment by which to
gain their living. This B&eacute;guine life was, therefore,
regarded by the Church as less meritorious
than convent life, notwithstanding the fact that
the B&eacute;guines were employed in nursing the sick,
attending to the poor, and in teaching young
girls reading, writing, and needlework. They
were free to go out with leave of the Superior
and visit their friends, or the poor in the town
outside of which the B&eacute;guinage was built.
Some of them might even live in the town,
wearing ordinary dresses, and keeping shops,
or maintaining themselves by their labour.</p>
<p>These rules of B&eacute;guine life were multiplied
in various ways as B&eacute;guine communities became
rapidly very numerous in Belgium, Holland,
and Germany.</p>
<p>But to return to Lambert, their founder.
His sermons, which contained solemn warnings
addressed to the higher clergy by reason
of their evil ways, very soon brought upon
him persecution and ill-usage. During one
of his sermons in the great church of S.
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Lambert he was seized by order of the bishop,
and imprisoned in the castle of Revogne. He
employed himself in his dungeon in translating
the Acts of the Apostles from Latin into
French.</p>
<p>Amongst other accusations which had been
brought against him, it was said that he had
prophesied the destruction of S. Lambert&rsquo;s
Church. Whilst he was translating in his
dungeon, it came to pass, on the 28th of April
1185, that the sexton of the church went up
into the belfry to ring the bell. He had taken
with him a pan of hot coals in order to warm
his hands. A coal must have fallen through a
crack in the floor into a space below, where
wood and straw were stored up. In the following
night the tower was seen to be in
flames.</p>
<p>The fire spread quickly, burning not only
the church, but the bishop&rsquo;s palace, which
stood near, the houses of the canons, and the
neighbouring churches of S. Peter, S. Trudo,
S. Clement, and the Eleven Thousand Virgins.
For three days the whole town was in the
greatest danger.</p>
<p>The charge against Lambert was now changed
into an accusation of sorcery. He was brought
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
to his trial, but the &ldquo;four discreet and learned
men&rdquo; appointed by the bishop to judge his
cause, could find no proof of any offence with
which he was charged. The people of Li&egrave;ge,
who were displeased at his imprisonment,
began to clamour for his release; and he
himself demanded to be set free, that he might
go to Rome and appeal to the Pope.</p>
<p>His request was granted. The Pope acquitted
him of all charges brought against him, and
authorised his work by instituting him formally
as the Patriarch of the B&eacute;guines.</p>
<p>He only survived this journey to Rome six
months, and died at Li&egrave;ge towards the end of
the year 1187. He was buried before the high
altar in his church of S. Christopher. Some
chroniclers relate these facts in a slightly different
way, according to which Lambert was
sent to Rome by the bishop with a list of
charges brought against him. But the important
point remains proved, that he was the
founder of the widely-spread community of
men and women known later as Beghards and
B&eacute;guines.</p>
<p>For after his death, possibly before, communities
of men were formed on the plan of
the B&eacute;guine communities. These men maintained
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
themselves by weaving or other handicrafts.
They met together for meals and for
prayer, but did not have their possessions in
common. They had no rule, but were accustomed
to wear simple clothes&mdash;brown, white,
black, or grey.</p>
<p>As time went on, the ranks of the Beghards
or B&eacute;guines were largely recruited by the
&ldquo;Friends of God,&rdquo; with whom they seem at all
times to have been in constant intercourse; so
that in the fourteenth century to be a Beghard
or B&eacute;guine, meant much the same thing as
to belong to the Waldensian Brethren. In
consequence, their persecutions during the
fourteenth century amounted at last to extermination,
their houses being replenished
from the ranks of &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; Roman
Catholics. The persons, therefore, from that
time onwards bearing the name of Beghards
or B&eacute;guines differed in nothing from members
of Roman Catholic orders.</p>
<h3 id="c7">The Great Sorrow.</h3>
<p>But to return to Matilda, who joined the
B&eacute;guines at the time when they had already
earned for themselves the reproach of Christ,
and when, on the other hand, there were those
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
amongst them who had wandered far from the
primitive simplicity of the first inhabitants of
Lambert le B&egrave;gues garden-houses.</p>
<p>By these latter (though they, too, claimed to
be the &ldquo;Friends of God,&rdquo;) Matilda was &ldquo;bitterly
despised.&rdquo; And she who had lived during her
youth in ignorance of &ldquo;the false profession of
people called spiritual&rdquo; had to learn amongst
&ldquo;the religious&rdquo; many a sorrowful lesson. Not
amongst B&eacute;guines only, but on all sides the
fact forced itself upon the heart of Matilda
that the Church was fallen from her first
estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, poor creature as I was, could yet be so
presumptuous as to lift up the whole of corrupt
Christendom upon the arms of my soul, and
hold it up in lamentation before God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our Lord said, &lsquo;Leave it alone, it is too
heavy for thee.&rsquo; And I made answer, &lsquo;O my
beloved Lord, I will lift it, and bear it to Thy
feet, and cast it into Thine own arms, which
bore it on the cross.&rsquo; And God in His pity let
me have my will, that I might find rest in
casting it upon Him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this poor Christendom, brought into
the presence of the Lord, seemed to me as a
maiden of whom I felt bitterly ashamed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the Lord said, &lsquo;Yea, behold her, blind
in her belief, and lame in her hands which do
no good works, and crippled in her feet with
evil desires, and seldom and idly does she
think of Me; and she is leprous with impurity
and uncleanness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the foremost in the guilt of Christendom
she found to be those who should have been
the pastors and teachers, &ldquo;the great he-goats,
who are defiled with all uncleanliness, and
with frightful greed and avarice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the Lord, &ldquo;the High Pope in Heaven,&rdquo;
Matilda turned for guidance and consolation.
&ldquo;When I wake in the night,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think,
have I the strength to pray as I desire for
unfaithful Christendom, which is a sorrow of
heart to Him I love.&rdquo; She prayed for the
priests, that from goats they might become
lambs, that they might forget the law of the
Jews, and think of the blood of the Lamb who
was slain, and mourn over the sufferings of
the Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas for holy Christendom, for the crown
is fallen from thy head, thy precious jewels are
lost; for thou art a troubler and a persecutor
of the holy faith. Thy gold is dimmed in the
mire of evil pleasures, thy purity is burnt up in
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the consuming fire of greed, thy humility is
sunk in the swamp of the flesh, and thy truth
has been swept away by the lying spirit of the
world!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas for the fallen crown, the holy priesthood!
For thee there remains nothing but
ruin and destruction, for with spiritual power
thou makest war upon God, and upon His
friends. Therefore God will humble thee
before thou art aware, He will smite the heart
of the pope at Rome with bitter grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in that grief and calamity the Lord will
speak to him and accuse him, saying, &lsquo;Thy
shepherds have become murderers and wolves,
before My eyes they slaughter the white lambs,
and the sheep are weak and weary, for there is
none to lead them to the wholesome pastures
on the high mountain side; that is, to the love
and the nurture of God. But if any know not
the way to hell, let him look at the corrupted
clergy, and see how straightly they go thither.
Therefore must I take away the worn-out
mantle and give a new mantle to My Bride, to
holy Christendom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou, son pope, shouldst bring that to pass,
thy days might be lengthened. For that the
popes before thee lived short lives, was because
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
they did not fulfil My will.&rsquo; And it was as if I
could see the pope at his prayers, and God thus
answering him.<sup><a id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></sup>
And in the night I saw the
Lord in the dress of a pilgrim, and as if He had
journeyed through the whole of Christendom.
And I fell at His feet and said, &lsquo;Beloved pilgrim,
whence comest Thou?&rsquo; And He answered, &lsquo;I
come from Jerusalem&rsquo;&mdash;by which name He
meant the holy Church&mdash;&lsquo;and I have been
driven forth from My dwelling. The heathen
knew Me not, the Jews suffered Me not, and
the Christians fought against Me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I prayed for Christendom; but the
Lord answered with bitter sorrow that He had
been dishonoured and put to grievous shame
by Christian people, though for them He had
done so great wonders, and had suffered so
great anguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it is with me, that longing and
humility and love, these three blessed handmaidens,
lead my soul up to God, and the
soul beholds her Beloved and says, &lsquo;Lord, I
mourn because Thou art thus warred against by
those who are the dearest to Thee on the earth,
by Christian people. I mourn because Thy
friends are sorely hindered by Thine enemies.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the Lord answered me, &lsquo;All that befalls
My friends, sin only excepted, shall turn to
them to joy, and for the glory of God. For
the suffering calls with a mighty voice saying,
that beyond all worship that can be offered
Me is the patience that suffers, and if for a
while I comfort not, it is far better than that
comfort should come from another will than
Mine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That there were some, the &ldquo;Friends of God,&rdquo;
who shone like stars in the dark night Matilda
thus found, and rejoiced to find. &ldquo;But that
the eagle soars to heaven,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no thanks
is there to the owl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no wonder that Matilda was &ldquo;much
and continually despised&rdquo; by the priests of
whom she gave so bold a testimony. The
Lord, she said, suffered in like manner, for
thus was He put to shame because in Him
was the truth. It was probably for some such
plain speaking that Matilda was refused as an
inmate of the convents to which she applied
for admittance.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Matilda and Dante.</h3>
<p>It was during the thirty years of Matilda&rsquo;s
B&eacute;guine life that she began writing the book
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
which has preserved her memory down to the
days in which we live.</p>
<p>Not only does the book itself present Matilda
to us as one of the most remarkable people of
her age, but in a book more widely known is
found, in all probability, the echo of her words,
and the picture of herself as she appeared to
the imagination of Dante. It is not necessary
here to go into the proofs of this identification
of the B&eacute;guine Matilda with the &ldquo;lady all alone
who went along</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Singing and culling flower after flower</p>
<p class="t0">With which her pathway was all painted over;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>the &ldquo;beauteous lady, who in rays of love
did warm herself.&rdquo; For those who desire to
trace the connection of Matilda&rsquo;s book with
Dante&rsquo;s poem, the proofs will be found in the
first volume of Preger&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of German
Mysticism,&rdquo; and in a lecture delivered by
Preger in the year 1873 on the subject of
Dante&rsquo;s Matilda.</p>
<p>The resemblances between Dante and Eckhart
have been remarked upon in a recent
work on Dante, where, however, no allusion is
made to other German writers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one who has read the discourses of
Meister Eckhart, ... will be struck by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
frequent and close resemblances, not of thought
only, but of expression and illustration, which
exist between him and Dante. So frequent and
so close are these, that the reader can hardly
conceive the possibility of their being due to
mere coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But whence did Eckhart derive his expressions
which reappear in Dante? &ldquo;Matilda,&rdquo;
says Preger, &ldquo;expresses herself in a language
higher than that of ordinary speech, and more
fitted to the nature of heavenly things. And
it may here be remarked, how frequently the
elements of the speech of speculative mysticism,
such as we may call the speech of Eckhart, are
previously to be found in the writing of Matilda.
But Matilda herself was not the creator of these
expressions, for her poetical nature was inclined
rather to expressions of thought in a manner
less abstract, and appealing more vividly to the
senses. But it would seem that before Matilda
and Eckhart, certain characteristic theorems of
speculative mysticism had become stereotyped
in the German language. They form the stock
of that capital of speech by which, especially
through Eckhart&rsquo;s writings, the German language
has been enriched. Matilda is, therefore,
of importance in leading us to the discovery of
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
how far Eckhart was indebted for his expressions
to that more ancient store of language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would occupy too much space to trace
here the remarkable connection not only in
general between the book of Matilda and that
of Dante, but between certain passages which
almost repeat themselves in the later book.
Others, again, which are not similar, yet stand
in relation to one another. The City of Woe,
for example, seen by Dante, is found also in
Matilda&rsquo;s book, but there it is &ldquo;the City of
Eternal Hate;&rdquo; and thus in many instances.</p>
<p>Matilda&rsquo;s book is commonly known by the
name, &ldquo;The flowing forth of the light of the
Godhead.&rdquo; She wrote it originally in Low
German, but of this original no copy is at
present known to exist. Soon after her death,
which occurred in 1277, a Latin translation
was made by a predicant friar at Cologne,
known as Brother Henry. Of this two copies
remain, one of the fourteenth the other of the
sixteenth century. The loose leaves had been
first collected by another Brother Henry, also
a predicant friar.</p>
<p>Afterwards a translation was made from Low
German into High German by a priest, Henry
von Nordlingen, assisted by a friend. It was
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
completed after two years&rsquo; labour in 1344. This
Henry von Nordlingen, a friend of Suso, gave
the High German translation to Margaret of
the Golden Ring. Margaret gave it to the
Waldschwestern in Einsiedeln. It was discovered
in the convent library of Einsiedeln
by Dr. Greith in the year 1861. In the year
1869 it was published in two forms by Dr.
Gall Morel&mdash;first, the High German copy as discovered
at Einsiedeln; secondly, a translation
into modernised German.</p>
<p>It is from the Latin translation that it could be known to
Dante.<sup><a id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The original book is the oldest work of its
sort hitherto known to have existed in the
German tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may justly be said,&rdquo; writes Preger, &ldquo;that
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
this book denotes a high degree in the measurement
of the culture of German women, and of
religious life in the Middle Ages. With freedom
and clearness of thought, the writer combines
tender and deep feeling; with a childlike
and na&iuml;ve perceptiveness, a true sublimity of
conception. Matilda frequently touches the
depths in which speculative mysticism is
formed, and her influence is to be traced
even in the work of the deep thinker who
was her compatriot, namely, Meister Eckhart,
in whose language we find the echo of
Matilda&rsquo;s speech. This language, which she
employs with freedom and ease, takes at times
the form of didactic speech, but it often rises
to musical rhythm, to lyric song, and to epic
portraiture. By the variety and life, as well as
by the plastic intuition of expression, this work
is distinguished from the monotonous writings
on similar subjects by older authors.&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Much more might yet be said of Matilda as
a writer and a poet. But it is with Matilda,
the persecuted &ldquo;Friend of God,&rdquo; the witness
for Christ in a time dark as she describes it,
that we have to do in the present instance.</p>
<h3 id="c9">The Book and its Origin.</h3>
<p>We have Matilda&rsquo;s own account of the origin
of her book. She says that when she began
to live a spiritual life, and &ldquo;took leave of the
world,&rdquo; she found that the fulness of her bodily
life and strength was a danger to her spiritual
life, and, therefore, after the manner of her times
she regarded the body as an enemy against
which she was called to wage continual war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that the weapons furnished to my
heart were the sufferings and the death of
Christ, and yet I was in great and constant
fear, and I thought to deal violent blows to my
enemy with sighs and confession, and weeping,
with fasting, watching, and prayer, and
with blows and stripes. And by this means for
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
two and twenty years I kept my body in subjection,
and had no illness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after this illness came. And then came
to me the mighty power, even the love of
God, and filled me to overflowing with His
wonders, so that I dared no longer keep silence,
though to one so simple as I it was hard to
speak. And I said to the Lord, &lsquo;O loving
God, what canst Thou find in me? Thou
knowest well I am a fool and a sinner, and
a miserable creature in soul and body. It is
to the wise that Thou shouldst commit Thy
wonders, then mightest Thou be praised
aright.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Lord was displeased at my words,
and He rebuked me, saying, &lsquo;Tell me now, art
thou not Mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, Lord, that hast Thou granted me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May I not, then, do with thee as I will?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, my Beloved; and I am willing to be
brought to nought if Thou willest it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, poor creature as I was, I went to
my confessor, and told him what the Lord had
put into my heart, and asked his counsel.
And he said I ought cheerfully to do that to
which God had called me. And yet did I
weep with shame, seeing before my eyes my
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
great unworthiness, and that God should lead
a despicable woman to write the things which
come from the heart and mouth of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Matilda, as is her wont, runs on into
rhyme&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The love of God has moved my pen,</p>
<p class="t0">My book is not from the mind of men.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And afterwards, she says, &ldquo;I was warned by
some that my book might give much offence,
and that it would be burnt as evil teaching.
And I turned to my Beloved, as was my wont,
and said to Him that if it were so, He had
Himself misled me, for it was He who commanded
me to write it. Then did He reveal
Himself to my sorrowful heart, as if He held
the book in His right hand, and said, &lsquo;My
beloved one, do not be sorrowful. The truth
can be burnt by no man. He who would
take it out of My Hand must be stronger
than I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I still answered Him, &lsquo;O Lord, if I
were a learned clerk to whom Thou hadst shown
these wonders, then might I write so as to bring
Thee eternal glory. But how can it be that
Thou shouldst build a golden house, the house
of Thy dwelling place, in a miry pool?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And He answered me, that when He gave
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the gifts of His grace, He sought for the lowest
and the smallest and the most unnoticed treasure
houses. &lsquo;It is not on the high mountains that
men drink of the fountains, for the stream of
My Holy Spirit flows downwards to the valleys
below. There are many wise in the Scriptures,
who are but fools and unlearned in other
learning.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further on Matilda says that in the German
tongue she found it hard to speak of that which
God had shown her, and &ldquo;of Latin I know
nothing. For that which the eye can see, and
the ear can hear, and the mouth can speak, is
as unlike the truth which is revealed to the soul
who loves, as a candle is to the glorious sun. Of
the heavenly things which God has shown me I
can speak but, as it were, a little word, not more
than the honey which a little bee could carry
away on his foot from an overflowing vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Lord, I will commend these
writings to Thy tender mercy; and with a heart
that sighs, and with eyes that weep, and with a
downcast spirit, I pray that they never may be
read by a Pharisee, and I pray also that Thy
children may so receive them into their hearts,
as Thou, O Lord, hast of Thy truth given out
of Thy store to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Matilda&rsquo;s book grew in an irregular manner
from year to year. She wrote from time to
time on loose sheets that which she believed
she had received from God. There is, therefore,
no connection in these writings, nor is there
any plan in her manner of writing. Sometimes
she wrote in prose, or in prose running from
time to time into metre and rhyme. Sometimes
she wrote in verse, in irregular measure,
and with or without irregular rhymes, each
division with a heading.</p>
<p>The friar Henry of Halle collected the loose
leaves, and before the death of Matilda he
divided them into six books. A seventh book
was added by Matilda after the death of Brother
Henry. Five of these books appear to have
been written before Matilda entered the convent
of Hellfde, and some can be dated by allusions to contemporary
events.<sup><a id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Apart from all that is interesting in these
books, as literature or as history, there remains
for the Christian reader who &ldquo;is not a Pharisee&rdquo;
the far more interesting field of research into
their value as spiritual teaching. The Pharisee
will find much to blame and to despise in the
ignorance and superstition of this B&eacute;guine of
the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>And in sifting Matilda&rsquo;s writings, as indeed
the writings of any man or woman, the gold, if
there be any, has to be separated from the dross.
The dross which had been accumulating for
twelve centuries formed a large amount of that
which Matilda believed she had learnt from
God. We can recognise the gold by the one
test furnished to us by Him who despises not
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
any, but teaches the most ignorant who come
to Him. If we apply to the writings of Matilda
this infallible test, of conformity to the Word
of God, we may be enriched by the gold without
being encumbered by the dreary heaps of dross
from which we have to sift it.</p>
<p>The book is supposed to be the expression
of the intercourse of the soul with God. That
it is really so <i>in part</i>, can be verified by any
Christian reader who will compare it with the
Bible and with the experience common to
Christian believers. That this true Christian
teaching should be mixed with the errors of
her time is natural, and we know that the errors
of each successive age leave their traces in the
books that are the most enlightened, and that
our own age is no exception.</p>
<p>The object in view in making the following
extracts from Matilda&rsquo;s book is not to present
it as a literary or historical study. Were it so, it
would be needful to give extracts from the false
as well as from the true teaching, so as to give
a correct idea of Matilda and her times. But
writing simply with a desire that the truth taught
to Matilda by the Spirit of God should be made
available for those in these later days who are glad
of spiritual food, the false and the imaginary will
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
be passed over, and the remainder given as
much as possible in Matilda&rsquo;s own words.</p>
<p>It must be remarked, however, that certain
expressions which in medi&aelig;val German conveyed
no impression of irreverence would
sound painfully familiar in modern English.
An equivalent has, therefore, to be found conveying
to readers now the same sense which
the original words would have conveyed to the
readers of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>It may also be remarked that the chief errors
to be noted in Matilda&rsquo;s book are a tendency
to the worship (in a lower sense of the word)
of the Virgin and the Saints, a belief in
Purgatory, and a certain weight attached to
the merit of human works.</p>
<p>Of the first of these, it may truly be said
that Matilda&rsquo;s references to the Virgin Mother
stand in remarkable contrast to the writings of
later times. If compared with &ldquo;the Glories of
Mary,&rdquo; now in popular use, they serve as a
landmark showing the downward course of
error and superstition in the Church of Rome during the past
six hundred years, though there were already those, such as
Bonaventura,<sup><a id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></sup>
who hastened the fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>It must be observed, too, in reference to
Matilda&rsquo;s allusions to the Virgin Mary, that the
chasm between the mother of the Lord and all
ordinary believers is very much reduced if
compared with that which exists in modern
Roman Catholic books of devotion, from the
fact that the place assigned to every redeemed
soul in Matilda&rsquo;s writings is far higher than in
most Catholic or Protestant teaching. Even
amongst Protestants it is not uncommon to
regard the redeemed as in a place below the
angels, or on a level with them. But to
Matilda the power and the value of the work
of Christ were so fully recognised, that she regarded
the Bride of the Lamb, or the individual
who is made a member of the body of Christ,
as in the highest place next to the Bridegroom,
the Head of the Body.</p>
<p>As regards human merit, Matilda only appears
occasionally to attach some weight to it in
speaking of others; of herself, she says she has
nothing to bring to God but her sin.</p>
<h3 id="c10">The Journey to Eternal Peace.</h3>
<p>It will be best to describe Matilda&rsquo;s spiritual
life as far as possible from her own words.
She gives us in parables the history of her
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
soul. Sometimes it seems well to give these in
full, at other times to give the sense whilst
omitting repetitions.</p>
<p>She tells us that for a long time she was
without rest or peace, knowing not only the
guilt, but the power of sin, and she looked
hither and thither for that which would meet
her need. And the mind, as it were, disputed
with the soul, for the mind would have her to
seek her peace in the things that could be seen.
And thus it said&mdash;</p>

<p class="t0">&ldquo;O soul, in the Magdalen&rsquo;s bitter tears</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c12">The Journey through the Wilderness.</h3>
<p>Thus much do we know of the journey of
this redeemed soul from self-occupation and
self-discipline, whilst Christ listened for her
voice in vain, to the knowledge of the peace
and joy that is in Him. And we know something
also of her earthly path, told us in a
spiritual song, which she calls &ldquo;How fair is
the Bridegroom, and how the bride followeth
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Behold, My bride, how fair My mouth, Mine eyes;</p>
<p class="t0">My heart is glowing fire, My hand is grace;</p>
<p class="t0">And see how swift My foot, and follow Me.</p>
<p class="t0">For thou with Me shalt scorned and martyred be,</p>
<p class="t0">Betrayed by envy, tempted in the wilds,</p>
<p class="t0">And seized by hate, and bound by calumny,</p>
<p class="t0">And they shall bind thine eyes lest thou shouldst see,</p>
<p class="t0">By hiding Mine eternal truth from thee.</p>
<p class="t0">And they shall scourge thee with the worlds despite,</p>
<p class="t0">And shrive thee with the ban of doom and dread,</p>
<p class="t0">For penance thy dishonoured head shall smite,</p>

<p class="t2">By misery left forlorn&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And scourged by want, and by temptation crowned,</p>
<p class="t2">And spit upon by scorn.</p>
<p class="t0">The loathing of thy sin thy cross shall be;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy crucifixion, crossing of thy will;</p>

<p class="t2">Yet thou shalt love Me still.</p>
<p class="t0">The spear shall pierce thine heart, and Mine shall be</p>
<p class="t0">The life that lives and moves henceforth in thee.</p>
<p class="t0">Then as a conqueror loosened from the cross,</p>
<p class="t0">Laid in the grave of nothingness and loss,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou shalt awaken, and be borne above</p>
<p class="t0">Upon the breath of Mine almighty love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thus the revelation of the love of God,
which was to the soul the opening of heaven,
the entrance into the Father&rsquo;s house where
was the feast of joy, the music, and the dancing,
was to lead to a walk of faithfulness here
below, which would bring upon the witness
of God persecution and shame and reproach.</p>
<p>Was it, therefore, that when the Lord had
spoken to the Pharisees of the love which
welcomes the publican and the sinner, of the
joy and gladness into which the returning son
was brought, He spoke to the disciples the
solemn warning lest the riches, not only
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
temporal, but spiritual, entrusted to them as
stewards should be wasted by them? Is it
not true that the revelation to the soul of
that which is in the Father&rsquo;s house, the joy
and the love, and the unspeakable riches of
Christ, needs nothing less than Divine grace
and power to keep us from misusing the
treasure entrusted to us, and making it an
occasion for feeding and exalting the fleshly
mind?</p>
<p>Therefore Paul needed the thorn in the
flesh, not to fit him for entering the third
heaven, but after he had been there; so
that the riches bestowed on him were not
made an occasion for self-glorification, but
he became a good steward of the manifold
grace of God.</p>
<p>It is to be carefully remarked in the writings
of Matilda, that she does not speak of this
entrance into the gladness of heaven as an
attainment. On the contrary, as we have seen,
she speaks of the result of her repentance,
of her conflict with the world, the flesh, and
the devil, as being but weariness and thirst.</p>
<p>It is only when Christ comes into the parable
that the heavenly experience begins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;before the time when
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Jesus Christ opened heaven with the key of
His cross, there was no man so holy that he
could, or that he might, ascend up into the
Eternal heavens&mdash;not with labour or with
the soaring of the imagination, not with longing
or the stretching forth of imploring arms,
not with the utmost yearning of his love. For
Adam had fastened the bolt so firmly, that no
man could open it. Shouldst Thou, then, O
Eternal Father, keep fast the door of heaven
with the bolt of Thy justice, so that sinners
must remain without, I turn me to Jesus, Thy
beloved Son, who holds in His hands the key
of Thine almighty power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That key was forged in the land of the Jews,
(and truly the Jews now would lock Thy people
out of heaven and keep them in bondage), but
when by Jesus the key was turned, the outcast
sinner could enter into Thy love. But it is
also the love of the Father who speaketh, and
saith, &lsquo;My soul endureth not that any sinner
should be turned away who cometh to Me;
therefore do I follow after many a soul for
long, long years, till I lay hold upon him, and
hold him fast.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the Jews who would lock the people of
God out of heaven Matilda, it need not be
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
said, had in her mind the Jews of Christendom,
the professing Church being constantly called
by her Jerusalem, and the formalist priests
&ldquo;those who follow the law of the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the name of Jerusalem was also employed
by her as a name of honour, applied to the true
Church of God, the true Bride of Christ.</p>
<p>For within the outward profession of Christianity,
Matilda recognised the living Body of
Christ. It is true that the two should have
been one and the same, as the soul and the
visible body are one person. But it was no
longer so, and Matilda therefore saw the professing
Church, Christendom, divided into two
parts, the living and the dead, the true and the
false, the children of God and the children of
this world. To her the true and living Church
was yet glorious and undivided, for it was
united in one by the Spirit of God. Whether
amongst professing Catholics or amongst the
&ldquo;Friends of God&rdquo; who stood apart from Rome
these living stones were found, there was yet
but the one building, the dwelling-place of
God.</p>
<p>If Matilda had no thoughts respecting the
&ldquo;Reunion of Christendom,&rdquo; she had a firm
belief in the Unity of the Church of God. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
could not be reunited, for it was the Body of
Christ. The prayer of the Lord &ldquo;that they
all may be one,&rdquo; had been heard. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo;
He said, &ldquo;that Thou hearest Me always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the ages when Christendom had
been divided into countless sects, the true
Members of Christ, whether they knew it or
not, had been, and must be, one. It needed
but to believe it, and to own it. But in order
to recognise it as true, it was necessary that the
eyes should be opened to see that the same
profession of faith, or all varying professions
of Christian faith, included the two classes,
the living and the dead; the living, united
together as the living members of the body;
the dead, but separate particles of mouldering
dust.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Reunion of Christendom,&rdquo; which would
have as its object to form into one mass the
living and the dead, can be but a denial of the
great truth that &ldquo;there <i>is</i> one Body and one
Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your
calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matilda, in a parable, describes the true
Church of God as a beautiful maiden standing
upon a mighty stone, which was as a mountain
of spices, and the name of which was Christ,
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
her feet adorned with a jasper stone, which is
Christian faith; and in her hand a cup, of which
she drank alone &ldquo;in unspeakable blessedness,&rdquo;
for the angels in heaven might not drink of it&mdash;it
was &ldquo;the Blood of the Eternal Son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matilda knew, and rejoiced to know, that she
was one with all the saints of all the ages, and
she tells us her experience of it also.</p>
<p>As Mary, she said, she knew how the sword
had pierced through her own soul also, because
so many who seem &ldquo;religious&rdquo; are lukewarm
and undecided for Christ.</p>
<p>As John, &ldquo;I know what it is to rest in the
unspeakable love upon the bosom of Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as Paul, &ldquo;Yes, Paul, I was caught up
with thee, and I saw so marvellous a place,
that thenceforth I could but long ever to be
there. And I drank of the wine of which the
heavenly Father is the cup-bearer, and Christ
is the cup, and the Holy Ghost the pure, clear
wine, and love is the plenishing. And love invited
me and welcomed me to drink thereof, so
that now I am well content to drink gall and
vinegar here below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And further, &ldquo;Stephen, I kneel beside thee
before the Jews who hated thee, amongst the
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
sharp stones, which fall upon me, great ones
and small ones, all my days. Those who seem
to be good people stone me in the back, and
run away, for they would not have me know it
was they who did it. God, however, saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Magdalene, I live with thee in the
wilderness, for all is sorrow to me except my
God.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c13">Practice.</h3>
<p>Of Matilda&rsquo;s daily life we know but little,
having scarcely any incidents recorded in her
book. Apparently, from various passages, we
can learn that, like most B&eacute;guines, her time
was chiefly occupied in tending the sick and
poor.</p>
<p>She considered it needful to visit the sick
in the B&eacute;guinage daily, &ldquo;to comfort them with
the lovely words of God, and to refresh them
also in a gentle way with earthly things, for
God is very rich. It is needful also to bestow
much care on the cleanliness of the sick-room,
and it is a good thing to be merry and to
laugh with them, but in a godly manner. And
it is well to serve them with ready hands,
and to ask them kindly to tell what are their
pains and complaints, and to show them that
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
they have a friend who will stand by them and
care for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Household matters, too, were a part of
Matilda&rsquo;s experience. &ldquo;It is right to go every
day into the kitchen, and to see that the needful
provisions are good, so that our stinginess,
or the cook&rsquo;s laziness, may not rob the Lord of
the bodily strength of His servants. A hungry
mouth will sing the Lord&rsquo;s praises ill, and a
hungry man is little fit for study, and this is
so much taken from the Lord&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matilda also wrote letters, containing much
wholesome advice. From a letter to a prior is
the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should listen to any complaints with
sympathy, and be very faithful in giving
counsel. If the brethren desire to build
magnificently, you should hinder this, and say,
&lsquo;Ah, dearest brethren, let us rather build for
God a beautiful palace in our souls, with the
stones of Holy Scripture and holy graces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first stone of such a palace, in which the
eternal God may dwell, and where His beloved
may dwell with Him, is deep humility. We do
not desire to build in pride and vanity, as the
lords and ladies of this world; but we do need
to build as heavenly princes upon earth,
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
knowing that at the last day we shall sit on
thrones with the despised Jesus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And make sure that during the day or the
night you find a full spare hour to converse
with our dear Lord and God, praying to Him
without let or hindrance. For the heavenly
gift which God loves to give to His elect, His
beloved children, is of a fine and noble sort,
and it flows freely to the soul that draws near
to Him, and to whom He bends down in His
infinite love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For His heart was so smitten with love to us
that He gave up all things, and emptied Himself
for more than thirty years, that He might
at last embrace His beloved, and give free
course to His love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you not think of this? Could you be
so uncourteous to Him, as to refuse Him one
hour a day in return for these thirty years?</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I, the lowest of the least, go to my
prayers, I adorn myself for this hour. I put on
as my only ornament my unworthiness, I array
myself in the miry slough that I am, and I am
shod with the precious time that I have lost day
by day, and I am girded with the pain which I
have caused to others. And I am wrapped in
the cloak of my sinfulness, of which I am full;
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and I put on my head the crown of my secret
faults, wherewith I have trespassed against the
Lord. Then I take the glass of the truth and
look in it to see myself therein, and alas! I see
but sorrow and shame. I would rather put on
this dress than any rich attire, although it were
better to be clothed in hell, and crowned with
devils, than to be sinful as I am.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in this dress do I go to seek Jesus, my
blessed Lord, and I find Him in no other way
so truly as in my sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore with joy do I go to Him, with
love and fear, and the uncleanness of my sin
vanishes before His holy eyes, and He looks
on me with such love, that my heart overflows
with love to Him. And all the guilt and
grief are gone, and He teaches me His will,
and makes me to taste His sweetness, and He
overwhelms me with His tender love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prayer has a marvellous power, it makes
the bitter heart sweet, and the sorrowful heart
glad, and the poor rich, and the foolish wise,
and the fearful bold, and the sick strong, and
the blind to see, and the cold to burn. It
draws the great God down into the small
heart, and lifts the hungry soul up to God,
the living Fountain. It brings together the
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
loving God and the loving soul in a blessed
meeting-place, and they speak together of
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another letter she says, &ldquo;That which
hinders spiritual people more, perhaps, than
anything, is the little importance attached to
small sins. I tell you in truth, when I neglect
a pleasant laugh that would have hurt nobody,

<h3 id="c38">Of the Two Golden Chalices of Sorrow and of Comfort.</h3>
<p>I, slothful sinner that I am, knelt down at my
hour of prayer, and it seemed to me as if God
were unwilling to give me the least measure of
His grace. Then would I fain have wept and
mourned, because of my sinful desires; for it
seemed to me that they were the hindrance to
my spiritual gladness.</p>
<p>But no, said my soul, think rather of the faithfulness
of God, and praise Him for His goodness.
Glory be to God in the highest!</p>
<p>And as I praised, there shone a great light
into my soul; and in the light, God showed
Himself to me in great majesty, and in unspeakable
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
glory. And it was as if He held up in His
hands two golden chalices, and both were full
of living wine. In the left hand was the red
wine, the wine of sorrow, and in the right hand
the most holy consolation. Then did the Lord
say, &ldquo;There are some who drink of this wine
alone, although I pour out both in My divine
love. Yet the golden wine is in itself the
noblest, and most noble are those who drink
of both, the red wine and the golden.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c39">The Working of Blessed Love.</h3>
<p>It were bitterer than death to me if ever I
did that which is good, without God.</p>
<p>This is the nature of the great love which is
of God. She does not flow forth in tears, but
burns in the great fire of heavenly glory. And
thus she spreads to the farthest distances, and
yet remains in herself steadfast and still. She
rises up into the nearest converse with God,
and remains in herself in the lowest measure.
She grasps the most, and retains the least.</p>
<p>O blessed Love, who are they who know thee?
They are those through whom the light of God
glows and burns. They dwell not in themselves.
The more they are tried, the stronger
they grow. Why so? Because the longer
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
they are in conflict, yet abiding in love, the more
glorious is God to their souls, and the more do
they see themselves to be unworthy and vile.</p>
<p>Why so? Because the greater the love, the
greater is holy fear; and the fuller the comfort,
the stronger the dread of sin. The loving soul
does not fear with terror, but she fears nobly.
There are two things over which I cannot
mourn enough&mdash;one is, that God is so forgotten
in the world; the other, that His people are so
imperfect. Therefore many fall, because the
godly have fallen before them.</p>
<h3 id="c40">How God speaks to the Soul in Three Places.</h3>
<p>In the first of these places does the devil also
speak, which he cannot do in the other two.</p>
<p>The first place is the mind of man, and this
stands open not to God only, but to the devil
and to all creatures, who enter in as they will, and
hold converse with the soul through the mind.</p>
<p>The second place in which God speaks, is in
the soul itself. And into the soul none can
enter but God only. When God speaks to the
soul, it is without the aid of the senses. It is
in a mighty, strong, and swift communication,
in a speech the mind cannot comprehend, unless
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the mind is so humbled as to take the
lowest place amongst created things.</p>
<p>The third place where God speaks with the
soul is in heaven, when God draws the soul
up thither, and brings her into His secret place,
where He shows her all His wonders.</p>
<h3 id="c41">Of False Love.</h3>
<p>All, who do not in all things cleave to the
truth of God, must fall with bitter loss. For
love, which has not humility for her mother,
and holy fear for her father, will be a barren
love.</p>
<h3 id="c42">Matilda&rsquo;s Faith.</h3>
<p>Thus far in the five first books of Matilda&rsquo;s
writings can we trace the history of her soul
before she found her last refuge in the convent
of Hellfde.</p>
<p>Preger&rsquo;s remarks are valuable as showing
how Matilda, in expressions which she borrowed
from the common stock of the writings of the
mystics, as well as in expressions of her own,
might appear to have wandered into the regions
of Pantheism. That she herself attached a
meaning to these expressions, which those who
were simply mystics, and not believers in Christ
as their Saviour, could not understand, seems,
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
however, clear. But the expressions were open
to the danger of being thus misunderstood. To
those who were mystics, and nothing more,
intercourse with God was a vague sentiment;
and what they called the love of God, was
merely a name given to their own human
thoughts of God, the God of their imagination.</p>
<p>But Matilda insisted strongly upon the truth,
that there is no way to God but through the Lord
Jesus Christ, the Saviour of sinners. That otherwise
all communication between the soul and
God is cut off, &ldquo;the bolt fastened by Adam&rdquo;
holding fast the door between God and men.</p>
<p>In speaking of some (no doubt the &ldquo;Brethren
of the Free Spirit&rdquo;), she mentions as the greatest
sin, and as the highest degree of unbelief, that
&ldquo;men should think to enter into the presence
of the eternal God, passing by the holy Manhood
of our Lord Jesus Christ. When such
people imagine themselves to have entered
into communication with the being of God,
they enter instead into eternal condemnation.
And yet by that means they intend to become
holier than others. They set at nought and
deride the words of God, which are written
regarding the Manhood of our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus to an unbelieving mystic, the term
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
&ldquo;union with God&rdquo; was familiar, and meant
nothing better than the dreams of a Buddhist.
But to Matilda, though she did not, and no
doubt could not, clearly define it, the truth was
revealed, expressed in so few words in the fifth
chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, where,
with reference to Christ and the Church, it is
written, &ldquo;He that loveth his wife loveth <i>himself</i>.
For no man ever yet hated his own
flesh; but nourisheth it and cherisheth it, even
as the Lord the Church: for we are members
of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.
For this cause shall a man leave his father and
mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and
they two shall be one flesh. This is a great
mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and
the Church.&rdquo; And again, in 1 Cor. xii. 12,
&ldquo;As the body is one, and hath many members,
and all the members of that one body, being
many, are one body: so also <i>is Christ</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That this truth, taught so plainly in many
passages of Scripture, notably by the Lord
Himself in the one word which smote the
heart of Paul, &ldquo;Why persecutest thou <i>Me</i>?&rdquo;
was the truth Matilda believed, seems to be
clear. But she was apt to use, when speaking
of it, the stereotyped expression &ldquo;union with
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
God,&rdquo; not perceiving that this is untrue, and
incapable of being symbolised, as in Ephesians,
by the figure of Adam and Eve. It is not
Christ as God, but as the second Adam, who
is there symbolised.</p>
<p>Many such incorrect expressions may, no
doubt, be found now in modern Protestant
books.<sup><a id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Preger further remarks, &ldquo;If we would describe
religious life, as shown in Matilda, by
its distinctive features, we should remark, in
the first place, that she is seeking after a
consciousness, or is, in fact, conscious of being
in immediate intercourse with God. Whilst
the majority of her contemporaries knew of
no relation with God, except through culture
or learning, or the medium of saints, or the
ordinances of the Church, and were satisfied to
know no more, Matilda looked upon all these
things merely as helps to personal and immediate
communion with God. This alone
could satisfy her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And further, she was aware that into this
communion with God she could only be
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
brought through God&rsquo;s free grace. And only
by free grace could she retain it. It is true
she speaks of human merit, and alludes to the
intercession of Mary, but in so doing was
rather expressing the ruling thoughts of her
age than her own innermost convictions. For
it is only in speaking of others that she admits
the merit of human works; she has another law
for herself, finding, as she says, no peace in the
good works of the saints, &lsquo;and as for me, unhappily
I have no good works to find peace in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which is the important matter with
regard to Matilda&rsquo;s faith is this&mdash;she grounds
her peace not on imparted, but on imputed
righteousness. &lsquo;It is a fathomless mystery,&rsquo;
she says, &lsquo;that God can look upon a sinner as
a converted man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in spite of this evangelical tendency in
her writings, we cannot but receive the impression
that in the heights of her communion
with God she at times loses the safe path.
The reason of this is, that the subordinate
place which she gives to all relations between
God and men by Church ordinances is also
given more or less to the knowledge of God
by means of the written Word. It does not
appear to be the ring in which her new life is
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
set; it would seem as though she endeavoured
to soar above it, in order to assure herself
more firmly of her state of grace by immediate
communications from God to her soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore she seems in some passages to
regard the written Word and the Divine Word
spoken to her as distinct, and on the same
level. Thus, as in mysticism generally, the
safe path is lost, and the soul is cast forth upon
the wide sea of subjective self-consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We feel the presentiment of this danger, and
the need of a safer path, in which the security
of Divine teaching is ours. This can only be
when the written Word is the seed of Divine
knowledge, and the faculties of man the ground
in which the seed takes root.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far Preger. It may also be remarked,
that whilst Matilda evidently grounded her
salvation and enjoyment of God upon the
atoning work of Christ, she does not allude to
it very frequently. We must remember that
amongst all the errors of medi&aelig;val Catholicism,
the blood-shedding of Christ was still regarded
as the means by which sin was expiated. It
was still an article of faith, though disfigured,
and often kept out of sight by all that man
had added to the Scriptures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Matilda, therefore, regarded it as an understood
necessity in Christian faith, and as not demanding
frequent assertion or proof. Had she
lived in our days it might have been otherwise.</p>
<p>That &ldquo;Christ once suffered for sins, the just
for the unjust, that He might bring us to
God,&rdquo; was a truth known and believed amongst
the &ldquo;Friends of God,&rdquo; Catholic or Waldensian.
That &ldquo;it is the Blood that maketh atonement
for the soul,&rdquo; that &ldquo;without shedding of Blood
there is <i>no remission</i>,&rdquo; that on Christ, the Lamb
who was slain, did &ldquo;the Lord lay the iniquity
of us all,&rdquo; they knew, and rejoiced to know.
However overlaid in Roman Catholicism by
the teaching of human merit, and of the mediation
and intercession of the saints, this truth
was preserved through God&rsquo;s great mercy in the
corruption of the Church. It may be found yet
as the anchor of the soul in the confession of
faith of many an ignorant and unlearned Roman
Catholic, who know little of the doctrines of
their Church, but who do know from their
service-books that &ldquo;Christ died for our sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three have ever borne witness on earth,
the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, and these
three agree in one&mdash;a witness never silenced
through the darkest ages of the Church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>It was during the last years of Matilda&rsquo;s life
that she wrote for &ldquo;the children of the world&rdquo;
a call to Christ.</p>

<h3 id="c43">The Echo of the Book.</h3>
<p>Matilda had a friend, called Jutta von Sangershausen.
A relation of hers, Anno von Sangershausen,
was the Grand-Master of the Teutonic
Order of Knights. Other members of the
family had offered their services to the order
in defence of their country from the invasions
of the heathen Prussians.</p>
<p>Jutta&rsquo;s husband had died on a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem. Her children entered various convents.
Jutta then joined herself to the B&eacute;guines,
and was employed for a time in nursing
the sick, especially those afflicted with leprosy.
In the year 1260 she determined to go forth
as a missionary amongst the Prussians. She
took up her abode in a forest near Culm,
where she lived as a hermitess, making known
the faith of Christ by word and example.</p>
<p>Matilda for a time resolved to go also as a
missionary to the heathen. But she was now
growing old, and worn-out by labours and
persecutions. It was evident that she no
longer had the needful strength. She was
grieved to the heart that she could not thus
make Christ known, and she laid the matter
before the Lord.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>He consoled her, and showed her that as He
had sent Jutta to the heathen, so had He also
given her His message, which should be sent
far and wide in the book which she was
writing.</p>
<p>And so it proved, as her book was widely
known and read for a considerable time after
her death. Even now it may be that the
words so lately brought to light in the convent
of Einsiedeln may lead some weary souls to
Christ. And still the reflection of the light
which shone into the heart of Matilda shines
forth more faintly in the poem known and
read through so many ages, and in so many
lands&mdash;the great poem of Dante.</p>
<p>It is now more than seventy years ago that
a young man travelling in Italy employed
himself at Venice in reading the <i>Divine Commedia</i>,
for the sake of learning Italian. He
had cared till then for the things of this world
only, but he left Venice with the first beginning
of a love which was to shape his long
life, and make him the means of life to many.</p>
<p>It was from the poem of Dante, he said,
that he had first learnt to know Christ as his
Saviour. He may be known to many as the
writer of the hymn so often sung&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A pilgrim through this lonely world</p>
<p class="t">The blessed Saviour passed;</p>
<p class="t0">A mourner all His life was He,</p>
<p class="t">A dying Lamb at last&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>a distant echo of Matilda&rsquo;s voice sounding in
many places still.</p>
<p>What was it that Dante learnt, or believed
that he learnt, from the lady whose joyful
singing sounded to him across the river of
forgetfulness, whose eyes shone with a light
greater than that of earthly love?</p>
<p>She explained to him her joy by the words
of that psalm, the ninety-second, which forms
a key-note to the poems of the B&eacute;guine Matilda,
of her to whom the Lord had taught &ldquo;the song
and the music of heaven,&rdquo; whom He had made
glad through <i>His</i> work, who triumphed in the
work of His hands.</p>
<p>It was in the work &ldquo;wrought in the land
of the Jews,&rdquo; the great work that &ldquo;loosed the
bolt with which Adam had barred the heavenly
door,&rdquo; that Matilda the B&eacute;guine rejoiced, showing
forth the Lord&rsquo;s lovingkindness in the
morning, and his faithfulness every night&mdash;the
work which &ldquo;the brutish man knoweth
not, neither doth the fool understand it,&rdquo; for
&ldquo;the preaching of the Cross is to them that
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
perish foolishness,&rdquo; &ldquo;the foolishness of God
that is wiser than men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the work which brought her into the
&ldquo;sweet garden of Paradise,&rdquo; where she was no
more a stranger, which had won for her the
right to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in
the midst of the Paradise of God, and to pluck
the flowers, which were hers, because they
were Christ&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It may truly be said that if there is anything
distinctive in the writing of Matilda the B&eacute;guine,
it is that she wrote from her own experience
of the gladness of the heavenly place, revealed
to her whilst yet in the body on the earth. She
had learnt that there is an &ldquo;earthly Paradise,&rdquo;
earthly not because it is of the earth, but because
it is a foretaste and earnest of the heavenly,
given to those who are still pilgrims upon the
earth.</p>
<p>To reach it the river had to be crossed,
wherein the old things pass away, and all
things become new; where the things that
are behind are forgotten, and the things that
are before become the possession, by faith,
of the redeemed soul. Her sins were amongst
the forgotten things, for God remembered them
no more, and the sorrow of the earth was
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
forgotten, swallowed up in the tide of eternal
joy, and</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The longing and love were past and gone,</p>
<p class="t0">For all that is less than God alone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, in the poem of Dante, does Matelda
draw him through the water of the river at the
moment when the remembrance of his sin had
stung him at the heart, so that he fell overpowered
and helpless and ashamed. It needed
that the sin should be left behind amongst the
former things that had passed away.</p>
<p>Those who have known the redemption that
is in Christ Jesus, the Fountain opened for sin
and for uncleanness, will gladly own that this
is the true Christian experience of the saints of
God&mdash;the land of Canaan beyond the river,
reached and entered before the warfare and
the trial of faith are over; the Father&rsquo;s house
become a familiar place before the murmuring
of the self-righteous is for ever silenced.</p>
<p>Did Dante know it as the B&eacute;guine knew it?
Was it in his case but a vague sense of a place
of joy and beauty which the soul might find
on this side of heaven? Did he know that
the river was a river of death&mdash;the death which
is the death of deaths, &ldquo;in the land of the Jews&rdquo;
so long ago?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>We cannot know. It needs the simple faith
of those who have become fools that they may
be wise. Then does the garden of the Lord
become a blessed reality, no dreamland, but an
eternal inheritance.</p>
<p>The B&eacute;guine had seen by faith her name engraved
on the pierced Hands and Feet of Christ.
Should she not rejoice and sing? Should
she not praise Him that He was wounded for
her transgressions, that He was bruised for her
iniquities, that the chastisement of her peace
was upon Him, that by His stripes she was
healed? And thus she knew that her &ldquo;robe
was white, for Christ&rsquo;s was white, and brighter
than the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How far this was the experience of Dante,
his poem does not tell us. But he knew that
there was an earthly Paradise, and it seems all
but certain that in Matilda&rsquo;s book he had found
one who was rejoicing there with unspeakable
joy.</p>
<p>The remarks of Preger in his lecture on
Dante&rsquo;s Matelda confirm the thought that this
is the true key to his description of the beautiful
lady, whose appearance formed the great era
in his spiritual life. The song taken from the
words of the fifty-first Psalm, &ldquo;Wash me and
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
I shall be whiter than snow,&rdquo; the introduction
into the knowledge of heavenly things, are but
an echo of the songs of the B&eacute;guine.</p>
<p>But the heavenly things of Dante are far
more clouded with the evil teaching of his
age than the heavenly experiences of Matilda
of Magdeburg. The glory of the Catholic
Church, rather than the glory of Christ, is the
light that lightens his heavenly Paradise. It
was the Lamb who was the light of Matilda&rsquo;s
heaven. In the bewildering medley of Catholic
and heathen mythologies in Dante&rsquo;s poem, it
is only here and there that a gleam of the true
light can make its way. But Matilda the B&eacute;guine
rose above the clouds and mists of
man&rsquo;s imagination, and she saw Jesus.</p>
<p>Preger refers us to the ordinary explanation
of Matelda and Beatrice; namely, that like
Leah and Rachel in medi&aelig;val theology, they
represent the life of action and the life of contemplation.</p>
<p>This theory as regards Matelda was, as
Preger observes, founded on the idea that the
Countess Matilda of Tuscany was the Matelda
of Dante. That the warlike countess was a
fair specimen of activity, we cannot doubt;
but that it had any resemblance to Christian
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
activity, is more than doubtful. Probably the
identity of name was the only foundation of
this idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; writes Preger, &ldquo;that Dante saw
these two women prefigured in a dream as
Leah and Rachel, and that Leah said, referring
to her sister, &lsquo;Her seeing, and me doing, satisfies.&rsquo;
But that therefore doing and seeing are
the only characteristics of these women is a conclusion
to which Dante did not advance, nor
need we do so. They <i>both</i> looked in the mirror,
but Leah first crowned herself with flowers;
and it was after hearing the call, &lsquo;Blessed are
the pure in heart, for they shall see God,&rsquo; that
this dream presented itself to Dante.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matelda, who corresponds to Leah in the
dream, conducts Dante into the earthly Paradise,
and the place accords with the guide.
She was not yet in heaven, the working-day
was not yet over, but Matelda was rejoicing,
not in <i>her</i> work, but in <i>the work of God</i>. She
was glad that the flowers of His garden were
her crown of beauty.</p>
<p>So wrote Matilda the B&eacute;guine&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I pluck the flowers for thee;</p>
<p class="t0">They are thine, beloved, for they are Mine,</p>
<p class="t0">And thou art one with Me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>It was a place in which the flowers of the
earth had never grown, and it needed the
washing which makes whiter than snow to
fit the soul for that garden of God upon the
earth. Therefore the song which came to
Dante across the river was the ancient song of
the soul that is washed from sin: &ldquo;Blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins
are covered.&rdquo; Virgil never crossed the river.</p>
<p>However clouded may have been the faith
of medi&aelig;val Christendom, the need of Christ
was felt. The distinction between a Christian
and a heathen was acknowledged as one which
told upon the eternal destiny of men. By
means of Christ the Saviour could the Christian
man pass on, washed and sanctified, into
the land beyond the river. A &ldquo;land beyond,&rdquo;
was that Paradise to men of the world of sense
and of earthly knowledge, but without the
knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ, whom
He has sent. And singing the song of the
forgiven, whilst she made garlands of the
flowers, Matelda appeared to Dante, separated
from him at first by the river of forgetfulness.
She drew near to him as one who dances.
She spoke to him of the nature of the mysterious
wind that moved the branches of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
trees which grew in the land &ldquo;given as the
earnest of eternal peace&rdquo;&mdash;the earnest whilst
here on earth of heavenly things, of the flowers
that grew from no earthly seed, and of the
river that flows from no earthly source, and
of the other river which divides the earthly
Paradise from the heavenly, as the river Lethe
divided it from all that was before.</p>
<p>And we see that Matelda is to Dante the
medium of supernatural revelations, just as
afterwards, Beatrice.</p>
<p>Matelda, then, in the earthly Paradise appears
as the representative of the insight into
the heavenly joy whilst still on earth, Beatrice
as the beholding of it when the earthly life is
past. And this knowledge of the heavenly
things was to be brought back by him who
had seen them whilst still in the body, as the
palm-leaves upon the staff of the pilgrim who
had been within the boundary of the holy
land.</p>
<p>And it was Matelda who drew Dante through
the river into that land whilst still upon the
earth&mdash;the land where he should hear the
singing, and know the sweetness, and learn
more in the Paradise here of the Paradise
hereafter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>It was the earnest of the inheritance which
was given to him through Matelda.</p>
<p>And truly this is the message and mission
of the B&eacute;guine, not as Matelda&rsquo;s, to Dante
only, but to us also, who can receive the message
without the bewildering counter teaching
of the corrupted Church. It is true the
message, more clearly given, is in the Bible
we have known so long; and it was through
the blessed teaching of that Bible that Matilda
the B&eacute;guine learnt it. But it is well for us
not only to read the glorious promises of God,
but to meet with those to whom they have
been fulfilled, the sharers of the like precious
faith with us, who now believe in Jesus. Now,
from the holy women of Hellfde have the
clouds passed away which at times hid from
them the brightness of the glory, but the words
of love spoken to their hearts by the mouth of
their Beloved remain to them as an everlasting
possession.</p>
<p>And are not the same words still spoken day
by day to those who have ears to hear? And
in the midst of this sorrowful world, is there
not still a blessed company who have entered
the same Paradise, and learnt the same songs,
taught by the lips of Christ?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>It will not render us less fit for the common
earthly life, that we have been there, in the
garden where the Lord God walks, and His
own are not afraid. In truth, it is only those
who have been there who have the healing
leaves for the sick and the suffering ones
around them. It is only those who see the
Son, and believe on Him, who are thus
brought back to the garden of the Lord, to
feed upon the fruit of the tree of life. And
these are they who are again sent forth as His
messengers into the world of man&rsquo;s exile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As My Father hath sent Me into the
world, even so have I also sent them into the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the Lord spake of all who believe on
His Name. The message sent long ago by
Matilda the B&eacute;guine has been heard again
after the silence of ages, and it is once more a
call to the sinful, the sorrowful, and the fearful,
who have been living in ignorance of the
marvellous love which is unchanged, and which
answers to the great need of our age, as to that
of the thirteenth century. May God the Holy
Ghost open the hearts of many to hear and to
rejoice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h3 id="c44">Matilda&rsquo;s Last Years.</h3>
<p>Matilda was fifty-three years old when, in the
year 1265, she took refuge in the convent of
Hellfde.</p>
<p>Gertrude von Hackeborn was not one who
would refuse admission to a persecuted &ldquo;Friend
of God.&rdquo; Gertrude had now been abbess fourteen
years, and was in the prime of her life
and activity. Mechthild von Hackeborn, &ldquo;the
maiden so marvellously lovable,&rdquo; as they said
in the convent, was then twenty-five. The
little Gertrude, who was to be the brightest
star amongst the sisters of Hellfde, was only
nine.</p>
<p>But during the twelve remaining years of
the life of Matilda of Magdeburg there was
time enough for some good seed to be sown
in the heart of Gertrude, which should one
day spring up and bear much fruit.</p>
<p>Soon after Matilda&rsquo;s entrance into the convent
she had a severe and painful illness.
But she was tended with loving care, and
found amongst her sisters of Hellfde a happy
and peaceful home. She in her turn was
regarded by them as an honoured teacher, and
her influence made itself quickly felt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>It was at Hellfde that she wrote the two
remaining books, &ldquo;rich,&rdquo; says Preger, &ldquo;in
light and instruction.&rdquo; When she had finished
the sixth book she thought that her task
was done. She therefore concluded it with
a word of farewell&mdash;&ldquo;This book was begun
in love, it shall also end in love; for there
is nought so wise, nor so holy, nor so
beautiful, nor so strong, nor so perfect as
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But afterwards Matilda felt herself led to
write &ldquo;more of that which God had shown
her,&rdquo; although she had prayed that she might
now lay down her pen and cease from her
labours.<sup><a id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the last years of her life she was obliged
to write by dictation, her eyes and hands
having failed her. The following extracts from
the last two books will show an advance in
the knowledge of Him she loved, and for
whom she laboured to the last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<h3 id="c45">The Labour of the Lord.</h3>
<p>The Lord showed me in a parable that which
He has ever done, and will ever do, to fulfil to
me the meaning thereof.</p>
<p>I saw a poor man rise up from the ground
where he was sitting. He was dressed like a
workman, in common linen clothing, and he had
a crowbar in his hand, which he thrust under
a heavy burden that was as large as the earth.</p>
<p>I said to him, &ldquo;Good man, what is it you are
lifting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to lift and carry your sorrows,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Try it thyself,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;with all
thy might, lift and carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then did I answer Him, for I knew Him,
&ldquo;Lord, I am so poor, I have no strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And He answered me, &ldquo;So did I teach My
disciples. I said, &lsquo;Blessed are the poor in
spirit.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And my soul spake to Him, and I said, &ldquo;O
Lord, it is Thyself. Turn Thou Thy face to
me that I may know Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And He answered, &ldquo;Learn to know Me
inwardly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;O Lord, if I saw Thee amongst
thousands, I could not but know Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>And then I said further, &ldquo;This burden is too
heavy for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And He answered me, &ldquo;I will lay it so close
to Myself, that thou mayest easily bear it.
Follow Me, and see how I stood before My
Father on the Cross, sustaining all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then did I ask Him to bless me; and He
said, &ldquo;I always bless thee. Thy sorrow shall
turn to a good blessing for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I said no more but this, &ldquo;O Lord, come
Thou thus to the help of all who love to
suffer for Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c46">The Prayer of the Longing Heart.</h3>
<p>There was one who for a long while, amidst
the mercies of God, and also many sorrows,
longed continually that God would release the
soul and take her to Himself. And the Lord
said to her, &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; Then did the suffering
one answer, &ldquo;Lord, I cannot cease from longing.
Oh, how gladly would I be with Thee!&rdquo;
Then said the Lord&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Before the worlds, O soul, I longed for thee;</p>
<p class="t0">And still I long, and thou dost long for Me;</p>
<p class="t0">And when two longings meet, for ever stilled,</p>
<p class="t0">The cup of love is filled.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<h3 id="c47">Prayers.</h3>
<p>Give me, O Lord, and take from me all that
Thou willest, and leave me but the desire to pass
away to Thee in Thy love, and to Thy love. O
well is me, and I thank Thee, King of Heaven
and Son of God, that whilst I was in the world
Thou didst choose me, and call me out of the
world. For this will I thank Thee eternally.
Thy holy sorrow, all that Thou hast suffered for
me, is mine. Therefore all that I suffer I offer
up to Thee, though how little is my suffering
like to Thine! Keep me always in Thy love,
that for ever I may praise Thee, Jesus, my most
beloved; and I pray Thee to loosen the cords,
and let me be for ever with Thee.</p>
<p>O Thou beloved Lord Jesus Christ, Thou
Eternal God, one with the Eternal Father,
think upon me. I thank Thee, Lord, for the
grace of Thine Atonement, wherewith Thou
hast touched the depths of my heart, and
pierced me through with the power of Thy
love. But when Thou dost touch my heart
with Thine awful, Thy holy tenderness, which
flows through soul and body, I fear lest I,
who am so unworthy of Thee, should be overwhelmed
with the blessedness of Thy love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Therefore I turn at times to pray for others
more than for myself, and withdraw myself,
as it were, from the fulness of the joy, through
love to Thee and Christian faithfulness. For I
fear the rising up within my heart of the pride
which cast down the most glorious of the angels
of heaven, and the voice of the serpent who
deceived Eve with the promise of vainglory.</p>
<p>I pray, O my God, that in continual love I
may receive and enjoy the gifts Thou givest.
I ask for the fulness of Thy love, that shame
and pain and bitterness may be sweet to me,
and that I may desire Thy will and not mine,
and that the fire of my love may burn in me
to all eternity.</p>
<h3 id="c48">Of the Good Works of Men, how They Shine by the Work of the Lord.</h3>
<p>How it is that the works of godly men shall
shine and glow in the glory of heaven, understand
from these words.</p>
<p>Wherein we were innocent of aught, in this
our innocence, the pure holiness of God shines
and glows.</p>
<p>In so far that we laboured in good works,
the holy working of God shines forth.</p>
<p>In so far as we clave to God with trustful
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
hearts, the tenderness and faithfulness of God
shines brightly.</p>
<p>In so far as we receive our sorrows thankfully,
do the sufferings of Christ shine forth.</p>
<p>In so far as we wrought diligently in holy
graces, does the holy grace of God shine and
glow in manifold brightness to all eternity.</p>
<p>And as here we loved, and as here we shed
forth the light of a holy life, in this does the
love of God burn and shine, more and more
unto the perfect eternal day.</p>
<p>For all that shone forth from us was the
light of the eternal Godhead. The good works
we did were given to us through the holy Manhood
of the Son of God, and we wrought them
by the power of the Holy Ghost. Thus all
our works, our love, our sufferings, flow back
thither whence they came, from the Three
in One, to His eternal praise.</p>

<h3 id="c51">Of a Sin that is Worse than all Other Sins.</h3>
<p>I have heard men speak of a sin, and I thank
God that I have not known it, for it seems to
me, and it is, more sinful than all other sins,
for it is the height of unbelief. I grieve over
it with body and soul, and with all my five
senses, from the depth of my heart, and I
thank the living Son of God that into my
heart it never came.</p>
<p>This sin did not have its source in Christian
people, but the vile enemy of God has by
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
means of it deceived the simple. For, led
by him, they would fain be so holy as to
enter into the depths of the eternal Godhead,
and to sound the secret abyss of the eternal
sacred Manhood of the Lord. If thus they
became blinded with pride, they bring themselves
under the eternal curse. They would
attain to a holiness which is reached by mocking
at the written Word of God, which speaks
to us of the Manhood of our Lord.</p>
<p>Thou poorest of the poor! didst thou indeed
know and confess truly the eternal God, then
wouldst thou also confess of necessity the
eternal Manhood that dwelleth in the Godhead,
and thou wouldst of necessity confess the
Holy Ghost, who enlightens the heart of the
Christian, who is the source of all his blessedness
and joy, and who teaches the mind of
man far better than all other teachers, and leads
us to confess in humility that which He has
taught us to know of the perfection of God.</p>
<h3 id="c52">How Love was seen with her Handmaidens&mdash;A Parable.</h3>
<p>In the night I spoke thus to our Lord,
&ldquo;Lord, I live in a land that is called Misery;
it is this evil world, for all that is in it cannot
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
comfort me, nor give me joy unmixed with
sorrow. In this land I have a house, which is
called Painful. It is the house in which my
soul lives, namely, my body. This house is
old, and small, and dark. In this house I
have a bed, which is called Unrest, for all
things are a grief to me which have not to do
with God. Near this bed I have a chair, called
Discomfort, wherein I hear of sins committed
by others in which I had no part. Before this
chair I have a table, that is called Distress, for
I am grieved to find so few spiritual people.
On this table lies a clean tablecloth, which is
called Poverty, that has much good in it, and
if it were rightly used it would be dear to those
who use it. On this table my food is placed
for me; it is called the Bitterness of sin, and
Willing suffering. The drink is called &lsquo;Scanty
Praise,&rsquo; because, alas! I have far too few good
works to be remembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this I saw as it were dimly in my soul.
And then was the true Love of God revealed
to me. She stood before me as a noble and
royal maiden, of stately presence, fair, and with
the roses of her youth, and around her stood
many maidens, who were the graces of the
Spirit, and they were come to be my handmaidens
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
if I desired to have them as mine,
for they were willing to serve me. They wore
crowns brighter than shining gold, and their
clothing was of green sendal.</p>
<p>And as I beheld her my dark house was
lighted up, so that I could see all that was
therein, and all that happened there. And I
knew the damsel well, for she had often been
my dear companion, and her face was familiar
to me. But as I have written of her oftentimes
in this book, I will not speak of her further.</p>
<p>Then said I to her, &ldquo;O beloved damsel, that
art a thousandfold higher than I am, yet thou
dost serve me with honour and reverence, as
if I were greater than an empress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she said, &ldquo;When I saw that it was thy
desire to renounce earthly things I desired to
be thy constant handmaiden, for I was seeking
those who from the love of God turned away
from the things on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I said, &ldquo;Beloved damsel, so long hast
thou served me, I would gladly give thee for
thy service all that I have or might have on
the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered, &ldquo;I have gathered up thy
gift, and will restore it to thee at last with
glory and honour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Then said I, &ldquo;Lady, I know not what more
to give but myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have long desired, and
now at last thou hast given me my desire....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parable proceeds to relate the service of
each handmaiden bestowed by Love upon the
soul, first True Repentance&mdash;then the maiden
called Humility&mdash;Gentleness&mdash;Obedience, Tenderness
(who was to give her help in tending
the sick, and in making coarse food and hard
labour sweet to her who served). Then came
the &ldquo;beloved damsel&rdquo; Purity, then Patience,
Holiness, Hope, and the &ldquo;glorious and holy
maiden called Faith.&rdquo; Then Watchfulness,
Moderation, Contentment, &ldquo;the dear maiden
who made the hard bed soft, and the coarse
food pleasant.&rdquo; Then the mistress of the
maidens, Wisdom, and a &ldquo;maiden unwillingly
praised,&rdquo; called Bashfulness. And lastly came
Fear and Constancy.</p>
<p>And these all being ready to serve, the soul
gave thanks, &ldquo;O thou dear Love of God, I
thank Thee that Thou hast brought to me so
many helpers on my way to heaven.&rdquo; And
the soul saw how all the saints and angels
bowed down in the wonderful glory of God,
because all they were, and all they did, was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
gift of grace from God to them. &ldquo;The saints
kneel down and bow themselves before God
in blessed love, and in joyful longing. They
thank God that His grace was ready and
waiting to bring them through this earthly
need, and to bear their sorrows.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c53">Four Things that Belong to Faith.</h3>
<p>That we believe in Christ as God, loving
God from the heart, truly confessing Jesus
Christ, and faithfully following His teaching
even unto death. I think that in these four
things we find eternal life.</p>
<p>But our faith must be a Christian faith, not
the faith of Jews, or of unbelieving Christians,
who also profess to believe in one God, but
who believe not in the holy works which He
has wrought. His work they despise, as we
grieve to know. But for us, our belief is that
God sent His only-begotten Son into the
world, and that it was His Will to do so. We
believe in the work and death of our Lord
Jesus Christ, whereby He has redeemed our
souls. We believe in the Holy Ghost, who has
perfected our blessedness in the Father and in
the Son, and who brings forth in us all the
works that are pleasing to God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h3 id="c54">From a Friend to a Friend.</h3>
<p>Great and overflowing is the love of God,
that never standeth still, but floweth on for
ever and without ceasing, with no labour or
effort, but freely and fully, so that our little
vessel is full and over-full. If we do not stop
the channel by our self-will it will never
slacken in its flowing, but the gift of God will
ever make our cup to run over.</p>
<p>Lord, Thou art full of grace, and therewith
Thou fillest us. But Thou art great, and we
are small, how then can we receive that which
Thou givest? Lord, whilst Thou givest to us,
it is for us to give to others. Truly our vessel
that Thou hast filled is a small one, but a
small one can be emptied and filled anew, till
it has filled a large one.</p>
<p>The great vessel is full sufficiency of grace,
but we, alas! are so small, that one little word
from God, one little verse of the Holy Scriptures,
so fills us, that we can contain no more. Let
us then empty forth the little vessel into the
great vessel, that is, God. How are we to do
this? We should pour forth that which we
have received in holy longing and desire for
the salvation of sinners. Then will the little
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
vessel be filled again. Let us empty it forth
anew on the imperfections of the people of
God, that they may fight more valiantly, and
may become perfected in grace. Let us pour
it forth in holy pity for the need of the Christian
Church, that is sunk so deeply in sin.</p>
<p>God has first loved us, first laboured for us,
first suffered for us, let us therefore be followers
of Him, and restore to Him in the way that
I have described that which He gave. Our
Lord suffered for us unto death, but a very
small suffering of ours seems great to us. But
the thoughts of God and those of the loving
soul meet together, as the air and the sunlight
are mingled by the mighty power of God in
sweet union, so that the sun overcomes the frost
and the darkness, one knows not how. It comes
all and alone from the sun. So comes our
blessedness from the joy of God. God grant us,
and preserve to us, this blessedness! Amen.</p>
<h3 id="c55">Something of Paradise.</h3>
<p>It was shown to me, and in my mind I saw,
what manner of place is Paradise. Of its
breadth and length I could see no end. First
came I to a place that was between this world
and the beginning of Paradise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>There saw I trees with much shade and fair
green grass, but weeds were there none. Some
trees bore fruit, but most of them only beautiful
and sweet smelling leaves. Swift streams
of water divided the ground, and warm south
winds moved onward towards the north. In
the waters were mingled earthly sweetness and
heavenly delight. The air was sweet and soft
beyond all words. Yet were no birds or beasts
in that place; for God had prepared it for men
only, that they might be there in stillness and
in peace.... I saw a twofold Paradise. It is
of the earthly one that I have spoken. The
heavenly Paradise is in the heights above, and
shields the earthly from all harm. But of the
heavenly Paradise Matilda only says that it is
for a time, and that it is the place wherein the
souls who have had no purgatory await the
Kingdom of the Lord, &ldquo;they move in sweet
delight, as the air moves in the sunshine,&rdquo; and
will one day have their crowns of glory, and
will reign with Christ.</p>
<h3 id="c56">The End of the Journey.</h3>
<p>It was evident to Matilda that her end was
near. Her age was what would be called old
age in the Middle Ages, when life was so much
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
shorter than in our time. &ldquo;I asked the Lord,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;how I should conduct myself in
these last days of my life. He answered me,
&lsquo;Thou shouldst do in thy last days as in thy
first days. Love and longing, repentance and
fear, these four things were the beginning of
thy course, and must therefore be the end
also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then said I, &lsquo;Beloved Lord, where, then,
are the two things that are the foundation and
crown of heavenly blessedness, where are faith
and full assurance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then said our Lord, &lsquo;Thy faith becometh
knowledge, and thy longing is turned into full
assurance.&rsquo; This I understood from the speaking
of the Lord to me, and I know it also in my
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a wonder to myself, and am indeed a
wonder. For when I think of death, my soul
rejoices so mightily in the thought of going
forth from earthly life, that my body is lulled,
as it were, in an inexpressible supernatural
quietness, soft and sweet, and my mind is
awakened to see the unspeakable wonders that
attend the going forth of the soul. Meanwhile
I would desire most to die at the time
which God has before appointed. Yet at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
same time I would willingly live till the last
great day. And my heart longs oftentimes to
live in the days of the martyrs, that I might shed
my sinful blood in true Christian faith for Jesus
my Beloved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I dare to say I love God, is a gift of His
pure grace. For it is when my sins and sufferings
are before my eyes that my soul begins to
burn in the fire of the true love of God, and
the sweetness is so surpassing, that even my
body shares in the Divine blessedness. I write
this as it were by compulsion, for I would rather
hold my peace, because I live in fear and dread
of secret tendency to vainglory. Yet I am more
afraid, when God has been so gracious to me,
that I, poor and empty as I am, have kept silence
too often and too long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From my childhood onwards I was troubled
with fear, dread, and constant sorrow of heart
in thinking of my end. Now in my last days
God has given me peace. And I have said
to Him, &lsquo;Lord, it likes me well to think of the
light and blessedness of thy heavenly glory,
of which I am so unworthy, but I still have
a great fear as to how my soul shall pass from
my body.&rsquo; And the Lord answered, &lsquo;It shall
be thus&mdash;I draw My breath, and the soul will
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
follow on to Me, as the needle to the magnet
stone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">And again she prayed that at that last
moment the Lord would come to her, as &ldquo;the
dearest Friend,&rdquo; as the &ldquo;Confessor,&rdquo; as the
Father.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Lord, I pray, when dawneth the last day</p>
<p class="t">These weary eyes shall see,</p>
<p class="t0">Come as a father to his darling child,</p>
<p class="t">And take me home to Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In these prayers and longings we find no
thought of purgatory. Yet as an article of her
creed Matilda believed in it. Nor did any
thought of superior holiness make her overlook
it in her own case. But the true spiritual
instinct of the new nature was stronger than
the force of education and of the authority of
the Church. How true is it that in spiritual
matters the head is no match for the heart.</p>
<p>So in the case of saint-worship&mdash;Matilda had
never renounced it, yet we see her heart turn
instinctively to God, as the needle to the pole.</p>
<p>The waiting time was one of suffering, but
cheered by the love and tenderness of the
sisters, who delighted to wait upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus does a beggar woman speak in her
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
prayers to God&mdash;Lord, I thank Thee that since
in Thy love Thou hast taken from me all earthly
riches, Thou now feedest and clothest me by
the means of others; for everything which
I can now call my own, and all that gives
joy to my heart, must now come to me from
strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, I thank Thee that since Thou hast
taken away the power of sight from mine
eyes, Thou hast appointed other eyes to serve
me. Lord, I thank Thee that since Thou
hast taken the strength from my hands, Thou
servest me with other hands. Lord, I thank
Thee that since Thou hast taken away the
strength of my heart, Thou servest me now
by the hearts of strangers. Lord, I pray Thee
reward them here on earth with Thy divine
love, and grant to them to serve Thee faithfully
till they reach a blessed end.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>How did Matilda die? We know no more.
Her death is mentioned in the <i>Mechthild
Book</i>, Matilda von Hackeborn being one of
those present at her death. But, alas! as it often
happens in the search for medi&aelig;val facts, we
are met instead by a relation of visions and
dreams. Matilda von Hackeborn tells us no
more than how she beheld in a vision the
departure of the soul of her namesake.<sup><a id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>The difficulty is to realise that in these
imaginary histories we are reading the writings
of some who, like Matilda of Hackeborn, had,
in spite of their visions, real intercourse with
God.</p>
<p>That Matilda of Magdeburg had this true
intercourse, based upon the written Word of
God, that she was one of those of whom the
Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I will love him, and will
manifest Myself to him,&rdquo; there can be no doubt
in any Christian mind. It was the time of the
conflict of light with darkness, of the prejudices
of early education with the experiences of
communion with the living God. The heart
received much that contradicted the nominal
belief, and this inconsistency was not remarked
by the recipient of the truth, because the mind
was not called upon to act in the matter.
It was left in inert subjection to the teaching
of the Church.</p>
<p>When nearly three hundred years later the
mind asserted its rights, and the Reformers
gave at length Scriptural proofs of that which
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the &ldquo;Friends of God&rdquo; had experienced, all
might have been well. But, alas! the weight
was shifted to the other side, and that which
had been a matter of the heart became after
a while a matter of the reason, to be discussed
and assented to by those who had no heart in
the question. We have to suffer for this in
our days. Let us learn not to be contented
with proofs in black and white, valuable as
they are. We need that communion of heart
with God by the power of the Holy Ghost,
which needs no proof, and which is the only
remedy for our lukewarmness, our worldliness,
and our joylessness.</p>
<h3 id="c58">The Nun Gertrude.</h3>
<p>It is of interest to trace in the convent of
Hellfde the results of the work and the teaching
of the Abbess Gertrude and of the B&eacute;guine
Matilda. It was not in vain that the abbess
had given to the Scriptures such a place of
honour, and had so diligently studied them,
and insisted upon their study. Nor was it in
vain that Matilda of Magdeburg had spoken
and written of the free grace of God, and of
the love of Christ that passeth knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>This teaching was the beginning of a stream
of life and light, which became deeper and
wider as it flowed along. And we find in
the next book written in the convent a clearer
and fuller confession of the truth. This book,
written in part by the Nun Gertrude, in part
by an unnamed sister, consists of five separate
books, together called <i>Insinuationes divin&aelig;
pietatis</i>. Of four of these books little can be
said, except that they consist chiefly of the
visions and revelations of the authoress, and
accounts of visions seen by the Nun Gertrude.
It is in the second of the five books, the only
one written by Gertrude herself, that we find
that which repays the trouble of sifting the
true from the false, and the gems of marvellous
lustre from the dust-heaps in which they lie
buried.</p>
<p>A translation of some of the most remarkable
passages in this second book has already
been given, as mentioned above, in the book,
&ldquo;Trees Planted by the River.&rdquo; But a few more
short extracts will perhaps add to the proof of
Gertrude&rsquo;s clear and simple trust in Christ, as
revealed in the Gospel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I consider,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;the character
of my life from the beginning and onwards
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
I have to confess in truth it is a history of
nothing but grace, grace without the smallest
deserving on the part of one so unworthy as
I am. For Thou didst of Thy free grace bestow
upon me clearer light in the knowledge
of Thyself, and Thou didst lead me on by the
alluring sweetness of Thy love and kindness.
I was more attracted by Thy love, than I
could have been driven by the punishment
which, on the part of Thy holy justice, was
due to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great power and sound strength of
Gertrude&rsquo;s mind,&rdquo; writes Preger, &ldquo;could not
allow her to satisfy herself with the visions in
which she had a share. She sought a firmer
foothold for her new life, a source which
should lastingly and invariably satisfy her inmost
being. And with the whole energy of
the mind, which had formerly been absorbed
in secular learning, she gave herself to the
study of the Holy Scriptures, and of such
commentaries as she could find to explain
them, amongst others those of Augustine and
Bernard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How deeply she felt the value of the treasures
laid up for her in the Scriptures, we
learn from the joyful inspiration which filled
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
her soul when reading them. &lsquo;She could not,&rsquo;
writes the unnamed nun, &lsquo;drink in enough
each day of the wonderful sweetness she found
in meditating on the Word of God, and in
searching for the hidden light which she found
in it. It was sweeter to her than honey, and
more lovely than the sound of the organ, and
consequently it seemed as though her heart
was filled with an almost unceasing joy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She copied out from the Scriptures and
from commentators whole books of extracts,
which she wrote for the convent sisters; and
was often employed from early in the morning
till late at night in endeavouring to write explanations
of difficult passages, so as to render
them more intelligible to her sisters. For it
was a part of her nature to lead on others in
the same path, and to work for those around
her, so as to exercise a wholesome influence,
forming them and helping them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She also provided other convents which
had few books with extracts from the Bible.
Thus the Scriptures were the Alpha and Omega
of her thoughts. All her reflections, warnings,
and consolations had a Bible passage as their
source. It was astonishing, her friend said,
how invariably the right word from the Scriptures
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
was ready to hand in each case; and
whether she reproved or counselled, she made
use of the witness of Holy Scripture as that
which no one might dare to gainsay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This universal tendency of her mind to
draw others into the enjoyment of that which
she possessed, and to work for this end, explains
how instantly and willingly she would
tear herself away from silent contemplation,
to use any occasion that presented itself for
active work for others. To return to contemplation
again was then easy for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We perceive from this remark the breadth,
and at the same time the strength, of her mind,
as well as the harmony of her inner and outer
life. This is not contradicted by the fact that
her friend mentions as her chief fault a certain
impatience and vehemence, for which she often
blamed herself. It arose from her strong impulse
to work for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preger further remarks: &ldquo;It was in the
ninth year after her conversion, 1289 and 1290,
that she wrote that remarkable book which
forms the second of the five books of the
<i>Insinuationes</i>. It consists of confessions in
forcible language, from the heights of the
strongest feeling and the clearest perception.
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
At the same time, the great gifts with which
she was endowed shine the more brightly
from their accompaniment of the most touching
humility. This book, together with her
&lsquo;Practices of Piety,&rsquo; a book of prayers, belong
to the most beautiful products of mystical
literature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her case, a progress from legal bondage
to ever-increasing liberty of spirit is clearly
marked. When once her new spiritual life
had had its beginning in evangelical faith, it
followed from the strength and wholesome
soundness of her mind, that the unfolding of
this spiritual freedom should proceed in spite
of the opposition of religious tradition, and
should prove victorious. It is of the greatest
interest to trace this progress as far as we
have the means of doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This onward path from asceticism, self-chastisement,
and bitter sorrow over the fallen
Church, to calm and happy communion with
Christ, was remarked by others, and the passage
from bondage to liberty was a cause of
joyful thanksgiving to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all times,&rdquo; writes her anonymous friend,
&ldquo;she rejoiced in such assured confidence, that
neither calamity, nor loss, nor any other
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
hindrance, nay, not even her sins or shortcomings,
could overcloud it; for she had
always the full and firm assurance of the rich
grace and mercy of God. If she felt herself
stained by daily sins, it was her custom to take
refuge at the feet of Christ, to be washed in
His Blood from all spot and stain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be remarked that Gertrude had not
yet fully apprehended the great truth that the
worshipper once purged has no more conscience
of sin, that &ldquo;by one offering Christ
hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,&rdquo;
and that for this reason there is no
repetition of sacrifice. For &ldquo;without <i>shedding</i>
of Blood is no remission,&rdquo; and the Blood of
expiation once shed, can be shed no more for
ever.</p>
<p>But it may be that Gertrude, like many now,
confused the recalling of that blood-shedding
which put away sin, a recalling which gives
comfort when we feel that we have sinned
afresh, with the actual cleansing, once and for
ever, in the precious Blood of Christ&mdash;the
actual cleansing never to be repeated, but the
comfort and peace founded upon it a constant
experience, which the heart may rejoice in on
every fresh occasion of the confession of sin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When she felt,&rdquo; continues her friend, &ldquo;the
marvellous power of the grace of God, she did
not betake herself to penances, but, committing
herself freely to the drawing of that grace, she
yielded herself as an instrument for loving
service, free to receive all that God gave, and to
be used by Him for His work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is further remarked that she looked upon
God&rsquo;s gift of grace in His Son as so immeasurable
and marvellous, that all human
endeavour and doings vanished to a point
when compared with it, and were not worth
mentioning.</p>
<p>And with regard to her own assurance of
faith, she saw that also was a gift of God&rsquo;s free
grace bestowed on her in spite of her undeservings.
It would seem as if this strong faith
and sense of God&rsquo;s unutterable love, had led
her entirely beyond the land of bondage in
which her fellow-Christians were living. She
was as a child at liberty in the Father&rsquo;s
home.</p>
<p>On one occasion when taking a walk, she
fell down a steep place, and getting up unhurt,
she said, &ldquo;O my beloved Jesus, how well it
had been for me had that fall brought me
quickly home to Thee!&rdquo; And when the sisters
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
who were with her said in wonderment,
&ldquo;Would you not be afraid to die without the
sacrament?&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I would desire
the sacrament if I were dying, but far, far more
do I desire the will of my God and His
appointment for me. That is the best preparation
for death; for however I die, my hope
is in the mercy that will never fail me. Without
that I should be lost, whether I died
suddenly, or with a sure knowledge beforehand
that the time was come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For she no longer regarded herself as apart
from Christ, but as in Him, and as one in
whom He dwelt, and therefore looked upon
herself as belonging to Him, and, consequently,
instead of mortifying her body, she looked
upon taking food or rest as something done
for the Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not,&rdquo; says Preger, &ldquo;that in regard to others
she had fully cast aside the prevailing belief in
the merit of works, but in her own case she
saw but her own sin and God&rsquo;s free grace.
And with regard to the works of others, she
considered no value attached to them if they
were done with a view to reward. Those good
works, she said, which people do from habit,
have a black mark set against them; those
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
done for Christ&rsquo;s sake, and by His power, a red
mark. But the red mark has a black mark
across it, if there is any thought of gaining
merit by those works. They have a golden
mark when they are done simply for His
honour, with no other aim in view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It should be remarked also that Gertrude
entertained strong misgivings with regard to
the common practices of exciting devotion by
appeals to the senses. The erection of mangers
at Christmas, and the representations in pictures
and images of the sufferings and the death of
Christ, appeared to her useless and dangerous.
She feared that true personal intercourse with
God in the Spirit and in truth, would be
hindered by these means.</p>
<p>Nor did she share the devotion of her
contemporaries to relics of any sort. &ldquo;The
Lord has shown me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the most
worthy relics which remain of Him are His
Words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such a soul,&rdquo; writes Preger, &ldquo;in which
Christ was so entirely the central point, it was
natural that Mary should recede into the background.
It is true that the spirit of the age
was not wanting in the influence brought to
bear upon her, and the cult of Mary does not
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
disappear, therefore, from the pages of her book.
But she tells us that she was filled with bitter
grief when, on one of the festivals of the Virgin,
she heard a sermon which contained nothing
but the praises of Mary, and of the value of the
Incarnation of the Lord not a word. After
this sermon, as she passed by the altar of the
Virgin, she could not feel in her heart the
sweet devotion to her which she had sometimes
known. She was roused into a sort
of displeasure with Mary herself, because she
seemed to her to stand in the way of her
Beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a painful example of the arguing of
an enlightened conscience with a conscience
shackled and enslaved by superstition. She
imagined the Lord would have her salute His
Mother, and her heart answered &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
And at last she resolved the difficulty by the
belief that in doing that which she was unwilling
to do, rather than that which would
have satisfied her heart, she was pleasing the
Lord Himself.</p>
<p>It is useful for us to follow these conflicts
of a heart devoted to Christ, with the awful
power of generally accepted evil teaching.
The spirit of the age is not at any time the
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
Spirit of God. How much power does the
spirit of unbelief, of lukewarmness, of corrupted
Christianity, exercise upon us?</p>
<p>It matters little that the errors are of a different
order. If Mary stood in the way of
Christ in the days of Gertrude, is there nothing
that amongst &ldquo;enlightened Protestants&rdquo; stands
now between the soul and the Saviour? Is
there nothing believed and taught amongst
us which blinds the eyes of lost and helpless
sinners to their need of a Saviour? nothing
which blinds the guilty to their need of the
Atoning Blood? nothing which turns the eyes
from Christ, the Coming One, to look for a
millennium, not of His Presence, but rather a
time when grapes grow on thorns, and figs on
thistles?</p>
<p>To return to Gertrude, groping her way from
the dim twilight around her to the glorious
Gospel day. She was once told that there
was to be an indulgence of many years proclaimed
to those who were willing to sacrifice
their riches to buy it. For a moment Gertrude
wished she had &ldquo;many pounds of gold and
silver.&rdquo; But the Lord spoke to her heart and
said, &ldquo;Hearken! By virtue of My authority
receive thou perfect and full forgiveness of all
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
thy sins and shortcomings.&rdquo; And she saw at
that moment that her soul in the eyes of God
was whiter than snow.</p>
<p>When, some days later, this confidence still
filled her with joy, she began to fear lest she
had deceived herself. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;if
the Lord really gave me that white raiment,
surely I must have stained it many times since
then by my many faults.&rdquo; But the Lord comforted
her, saying, &ldquo;Is it not true that I always
retain in My hand a greater power than I
bestow upon My creatures? Hast thou not
seen how the sun by the power of its heat
draws out the spots and stains from the white
linen that it bleaches, and makes it whiter than
it was before? How much more can I, the
Creator of the sun, keep in stainless whiteness
the soul upon whom I have had mercy, pouring
forth upon it the warmth of my burning
love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, again, we see that Gertrude arrived at
the right sense of perfect forgiveness, though
it was rather the Love of Christ than His
bloodshedding which gave her this assurance.
She no doubt had an unclouded belief in the
expiation made by His blood, as we see from
other passages in her book. But in resting her
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
assurance on His love, if that were (as happily
it was not) the whole ground of her confidence,
she would have failed in the possession of unchanging
peace. She would have rejoiced at
the moments when she realised His great love,
and have feared and trembled when the sense
of it was overclouded by sin and infirmity.
The Christian taught of God looks back to
see how Christ once bore his sins in His own
body on the cross, and looks up to see Christ
in glory as the proof that those sins are for
ever put away. He rests upon these unchangeable
facts&mdash;all <i>the more</i>, therefore, realising the
marvellous love of the Divine Saviour who
died for him, and rose again for his justification.</p>
<p>Gertrude did seek and find this solid foundation.
&ldquo;The longing for certainty,&rdquo; writes
Preger, &ldquo;characterises her inner life. Her
powerful mind could only be satisfied in the
firm grasping of evident truth. This led her
to feel the necessity of immediate intercourse
with God.&rdquo; And when she had the assurance
of knowing the will of God, she acted, therefore,
with an extraordinary decision and
promptness. The sisters were astonished at
the suddenness of her determinations, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
speed with which she carried them out. They
suspected at first that she was self-willed, but
they came afterwards to the conclusion that
she was carrying out the will of God.</p>
<p>In the last years of her life her longing
to depart and to be with Christ became so
intense, that she fought against it as a mark of
an impatient spirit. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Preger, &ldquo;to
what clearness and assurance of Divine truth
she had been led, we see from the joyful
confidence with which she looked forward to
death and judgment.&rdquo; In the last chapters
of her book of prayers, before mentioned, we
find a passage with which it is well to conclude
the history of her spiritual life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Truth, Thou hast for Thine inseparable
companions Justice and Equity. In number,
measure, and weight Thy judgment stands firm.
That which Thou weighest, Thou weighest in
a perfect balance. Woe is me, a thousandfold
woe, if I fall into Thine hands and there
should be found no substitute to take my
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Love Divine, Thou wilt provide the substitute.
Thou wilt answer for me. Thou wilt
undertake my cause, that I may live because
of Thee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I will do. I will take the cup
of salvation. The Cup, which is Jesus, I will
place in the empty scale. Thus&mdash;thus all my
deficiency will be made up, all my sin covered,
all my ruin restored, and all my imperfection
will become more than perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, at this hour (six o&rsquo;clock) Thy Son
Jesus was brought to judgment. Thou didst
lay upon Him the sin of the whole world, upon
Him who was sinless, but who was called to
render account for my sin and my guilt. Yea,
O my God, I receive Him from Thine hand
as my companion in the judgment; I receive
Him, the Most Innocent, the Most Beloved,
Him who was condemned and slain for love
to me, and now Thy gift, O my loving God,
to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O blessed Truth, to come before Thee without
my Jesus would be my fear and terror, but
to come with Him is joy and gladness. O
Truth, now mayest Thou sit down on the judgment-seat
and bring against me what Thou wilt.
I fear nothing. I know&mdash;I know that Thy
glorious face will have no terror for me, for
He is with me, who is all my hope and all
my assurance. I would ask, how canst Thou
now condemn me when I have my Jesus as
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
mine, that dearest, that truest Saviour, who
has borne all my sin and misery that He might
win for me eternal pardon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My beloved Jesus, blessed Pledge of my
redemption, Thou wilt appear before the judgment-seat
for me. By Thy side do I stand
there. Thou the Judge, and Thou the Substitute
also. Then wilt Thou recount what
Thou didst become for love of me, how tenderly
Thou hast loved me, how dearly Thou
hast bought me, that I through Thee might
be righteous before God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast betrothed me to Thyself; how
could I be lost? Thou hast borne my sins.
Thou hast died, that to all eternity I might
never die. All that is Thine Thou hast freely
given me, that I through Thy deserving might
be rich. Even so, in the hour of death, I shall
be judged according to that innocence, according
to that purity, which Thou hast freely given
me, when Thou didst pay the whole debt for
me by giving Thyself. Thou wert judged and
condemned for my sake, that I, poor and helpless
as I am, might be more than rich in all
the wealth that is Thine, and mine through
Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h3 id="c59">The Voice that for ever Speaks.</h3>
<p>Thus to the ear that listens for the One beloved
Voice, come from those old times the
familiar tones, the household words of the
family of God. These souls, so misled, so
darkened by the mists of evil teaching, yet by
the power of the Holy Ghost saw the Son and
believed on Him, and had everlasting life.
His sheep followed Him, for they knew His
voice, and their souls were filled with love
and praise.</p>
<p>Did they not often mistake for His voice the
imaginations of their own hearts? Yes, often
they did so, and perhaps we do it less often,
because less often do we listen for His voice.
He speaks and we are deaf, and we go on our
way expecting no word from His lips, and
therefore there is nothing which we suppose to
be that Voice, and our delusions are altogether
of another nature.</p>
<p>Our delusion in these days is that there is
no immediate, daily, hourly communication
between the soul and God. We do not mistake
by regarding false coin as true; our mistake is
that the true coin has ceased to exist since the
days when John and Paul spoke to the Lord
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and He answered them, and the Holy Spirit
spoke, and they listened.</p>
<p>Yet still as of old there are those whose eyes
have been anointed with eye-salve and they see
Him, and their ears unstopped and they hear
Him, and they can bear witness to the truth
that the Comforter abides with us for ever, and
takes still of the things of Jesus and shows them
unto us; and these can recognise in the old
histories of the saints of God the same voice
and the same teaching, and can trace it back
to the written Word, to which it answers as the
stamp to the seal.</p>
<p>It is well for us also to bear in mind the
delusions, and, to us, inconceivable errors
which were mistaken in past ages for the
voice of God. That the chief work of Satan
has been from the beginning to counterfeit
the work of God, we know from revelation.
Nor have we to be on our guard against
Satanic power alone. The tremendous force
of early education, of the general opinion
of the world around us, do not act less
powerfully upon us than upon those in former
days.</p>
<p>It is true that the course of this age is
&ldquo;according to the prince of the power of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
air, the spirit that now worketh in the children
of disobedience.&rdquo; The course of each age
since Adam sinned has been thus shaped.
But mere natural tendency to receive what we
call truths, without taking the trouble to think,
and to form opinions, as well as courses of
action, by habit simply and only, can lead us
far enough astray without any other misleading
force.</p>
<p>The convent of Hellfde is a remarkable
proof of the power of Satan, and of the distortion
of our nature, acting upon those who were
true-hearted believers in the Lord Jesus Christ,
true children of God, and truly taught by Him
in the midst of many delusions. Had they
applied the test of Holy Scripture to all which
they believed to be the voice of God, a very
small part of it would have stood the test, in
the case of the sister, for example, who wrote
four of the five parts of the <i>Gertrude Book</i>.
The remarkable difference of the second book
written by Gertrude herself from the four
others, remains as a proof of the fact that the
&ldquo;entrance of the Lord&rsquo;s Word giveth light and
understanding to the simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the case of communications regarded
as the voice of God, and <i>not</i> standing in
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
opposition to His Word, must not a further
distinction be made? Even then the mind
may possibly be exercised in simply recalling
passages of Scripture, and may be influenced
by them as in the case of ordinary writings.
Is there nothing more than this which is meant
by the statements of the Lord Jesus Christ
when speaking of the intercourse between the
soul and Himself?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do ye not understand My speech?
even because ye cannot hear My word.&rdquo; There
is, then, a hearing of which the unbelieving
man is incapable. &ldquo;He that is of God heareth
God&rsquo;s words. Ye therefore hear them not,
because ye are not of God.&rdquo; Thus there are
those who &ldquo;hear indeed and understand not,
and see indeed but perceive not.&rdquo; On the
other hand, there are the sheep of Christ,
&ldquo;who follow Him, for they know His voice.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them,
and they follow Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How, then, was it that the true sheep of
Christ in the convent of Hellfde followed at
times the voice of strangers, and mistook it
for His own?<sup><a id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></sup>
Should we therefore conclude
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
that <i>all</i> they received as His was but the working
of their own minds, or a snare of the
evil one?</p>
<p>If so, the Lord Himself is no longer the
Truth. He has solemnly declared to us, that
for ever He would hold intercourse with His
saints by the power of the Holy Ghost. He
has given us the plain assurance, &ldquo;Lo, I am
with you always, even unto the end of the
world (the age).&rdquo; The saints of all ages have
claimed these promises, and have found them
true.</p>
<p>But the world cannot receive the Spirit of
Truth, because it seeth Him not, neither
knoweth Him. Nevertheless &ldquo;<i>Ye</i> know Him,
for He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
I will not leave you comfortless, I will come to
you. Yet a little while <i>the world</i> seeth Me no
more; but ye see Me: because I live ye shall
live also. At that day ye shall know that I am
in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
And again, &ldquo;He that loveth Me shall be loved
of My Father, and I will love him, and will
manifest Myself to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus in spite of delusions caused by the
false teaching of the corrupted Church, in spite
of the hallucinations caused by unnatural
bodily conditions, the Lord was true to His
word, and made to His servants that revelation
of His love that passeth knowledge, which
marks their testimony.</p>
<p>And because it passeth knowledge, and all
that it is possible for the heart of man to conceive,
we recognise it as His revelation to the
soul. The God of Catholicism was a Judge,
awful and terrible. Even the thought that
the righteous anger of the Father needed to be
appeased by the merciful intervention of the
Son, gave place in time to the thought that
the Son also was but a righteous Judge, in
whom was justice without mercy. Therefore
it was necessary that His mother should be
the hope and refuge of sinners, and that her
intercession should incline His heart to pity.
And there followed in due time a host of other
mediators between God and man, to whom the
sinful and the suffering should turn rather than
to the great and dreadful God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>And it was in the face of this teaching that
those who knew His voice had the absolute
assurance of His immeasurable and unspeakable
love. They passed, as it were, through the
host of mediators and intercessors to cast themselves
at His feet, and to wash them with their
tears, and anoint them with the love which the
Holy Spirit of God had shed abroad in their
hearts.</p>
<p>Nor had they, as some Protestants in our
days, the strange delusion that there is a something
called &ldquo;religion&rdquo; to which, if they turn
in their last days, they may perhaps be fit for
heaven. They knew, and we know, if we will
look into our hearts, that this is not the answer
to our need.</p>
<p>Can &ldquo;religion&rdquo; love us? We need love.
We need a living heart who can love us with
a love utterly unchangeable and eternal. And
we find it in Him whose name is Love; in
Him who is absolutely just, but who is also
the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.
&ldquo;The Just God and the Saviour&rdquo;&mdash;well may
it be added, &ldquo;there is none besides Me.&rdquo; No
God has ever been invented by the thoughts
of man who can be at once the Just One and
the Saviour, in whom &ldquo;Mercy and Truth are
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
met together, in whom Righteousness and
Peace have kissed each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We find this revelation of Himself all through
the ages, and it is thus that He is now revealed
to every soul whose eyes have been opened to
see Him, whose ears have been unstopped to
hear that marvellous Voice, which is as clear
and distinct to the soul now, as will be the
shout, and the voice of the Archangel, and the
trumpet of God in the day that is to be.</p>
<p>Is it not by the teaching of God Himself,
through His Word and Spirit, that we find the
solid path upon which to walk, day by day, in
all circumstances of our ordinary life? He
thus becomes wisdom to the foolish, and
strength to the weak. He directs the path
of those who in all their ways acknowledge
Him. We find a safer guide than our own
understanding, than the &ldquo;common-sense&rdquo; of
the natural heart, which may mislead, and will
mislead, those who have no better teacher, as
dreams and visions misled the true-hearted
servants of God in former days.</p>
<p>The guidance and teaching of Him who is
the Wisdom of God, and who hears and
answers the prayers of those who seek Him,
will assuredly not lead us to commit acts of
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
folly; but the common-sense will be more fully
exercised, because all existing facts will then
be taken into account.</p>
<p>The greatest and most universal failure in
common-sense must be the leaving out of God
in all our thoughts; and therefore is it written
of the natural man, not only &ldquo;there is none
that doeth good, no not one,&rdquo; but also, &ldquo;there
is none that understandeth, there is none that
seeketh after God.&rdquo;</p>

been published very early, as it does not contain the seventh
book, probably, therefore, considerably earlier than the year 1300.
We know that the 6th and 7th Cantos of the <i>Purgatorio</i> were
written between 1308 and 1313; the 24th Canto after the year
1314. If Dante passed through Cologne in his wanderings, as
appears probable from his reference to Cologne in the <i>Inferno</i>,
xxiii. 63, he may there have seen the book. It was, however,
no doubt widely circulated before the end of the thirteenth
century. The supposition that Matilda of Hackeborn was the
origin of Dante&rsquo;s Matilda is disproved by the later date of the
<i>Mechthilden Buch</i>, which could scarcely have been published
before the year 1310.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a></sup>In his
lecture on Dante&rsquo;s Matilda, delivered at a later
period, Preger raises the question whether the book of the
B&eacute;guine is of such a nature as to have attracted in so considerable
a measure the appreciation of a Dante. &ldquo;I must here only
repeat,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that which I have formerly written with
regard to the spirit and poetical power of this work, as it appears
in Morel&rsquo;s edition. I think I may say that amongst all the
known works of this nature up to the end of the thirteenth century,
there is none that attains to the importance of this work.
Only the second part of the book of the Nun Gertrude, written by
herself, can be placed in any point of view in comparison with it.
It is evident that the B&eacute;guine Matilda was of sufficient significance
to make an impression on Dante, and to be used by him as
a type of that form of contemplation which I have described
under the name of practical mysticism.&rdquo;

state of mental disease, in which clear and reasonable thought
was at times obliterated. It was a spiritual alcohol or opium
that was constantly measured out by the accredited teachers of

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
